It has previously been used in Vietnam . In British Hong Kong in the 1970s , citizens were also highly encouraged to have two children as a limit ( although it was not mandated by law ) , and it was used as part of the region 's family planning strategies . Since 2016 , it has been implemented in China . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 China </Li> <Li> 2 Hong Kong </Li> <Li> 3 Iran </Li> <Li> 4 Singapore </Li> <Li> 5 United Kingdom </Li> <Li> 6 Vietnam <Ul> <Li> 6.1 History </Li> <Li> 6.2 Administration </Li> <Li> 6.3 Current status </Li> <Li> 6.4 Effects of this policy <Ul> <Li> 6.4. 1 Reduction of the birthrate </Li> <Li> 6.4. 2 Sex - based differences </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6.5 Criticism <Ul> <Li> 6.5. 1 Inadequate contraceptives </Li> <Li> 6.5. 2 Increased abortion </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 Further reading </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> China ( edit ) </H2> <P> During the 1970s , Chinese citizens were encouraged to have only one child . The ongoing Cultural Revolution and the strain it placed on the nation were large factors . During this time , the birth rate dropped from nearly 6 children per woman to just under 3 . ( The colloquial term `` births per woman '' is usually formalized as the Total Fertility Rate ( TFR ) , a technical term in demographic analysis meaning the average number of children that would be born to a woman over her lifetime if she were to experience the exact current age - specific fertility rates through her lifetime . ) </P> <P> As China 's youngest generation ( born under the one - child policy , which first became a requirement for most couples in 1979 ) came of age for formation of the next generation , a single child would be left with having to provide support for his or her two parents and four grandparents . In response to this issue , by 2009 all provinces allowed couples to have two children if both parents were only children themselves . After a policy change of the Chinese government in late 2013 , most Chinese provinces further relaxed the policy in 2014 by allowing families to have two children if one of the parents is an only child . </P> <P> Han Chinese living in rural areas were often permitted to have two children , as exceptions existed if the first child was a daughter . Because of cases such as these , as well as urban couples who simply paid a fine ( or `` social maintenance fee '' ) to have more children , the overall fertility rate of mainland China is , in fact , closer to two children per family than to one child per family ( 1.8 ) . In addition , since 2012 , Han Chinese in southern Xinjiang were allowed to have two children . This , along with incentives and restrictions against higher Muslim Uyghur fertility , was seen as attempt to counter the threat of Uyghur separatism . </P> <P> On October 29 , 2015 , Xinhua reported the change in the existing law to a two - child policy citing a statement from the Communist Party of China . The new policy allowing Chinese couples to have two children was proposed in order to help address the aging issue in China . On December 27 , 2015 , the new law was passed in the session of the National People 's Congress Standing Committee , which governs country 's laws , effective from January 1 , 2016 . </P> <H2> Hong Kong ( edit ) </H2> In Hong Kong , the Two is Enough campaign in the 1970s encouraged people to have two or fewer children in each family , contributing to the reduced birth rate in the following decades ( poster with actress Fung Bo Bo ) See also : Demographics of Hong Kong <P> In British Hong Kong , the Eugenics League was founded in 1936 , which became The Family Planning Association of Hong Kong in 1950 . The organization provides family planning advice , sex education , and birth control services to the general public of Hong Kong . In the 1970s due to the rapidly rising population , it launched the `` Two is Enough '' campaign , which reduced the general birth rate through educational means . The organization founded the International Planned Parenthood Federation , with its counterparts in seven other countries . The total fertility rate in Hong Kong is currently 1.04 children per woman , one of the lowest in the world . Although the `` Two is Enough '' campaign found widespread approval , it does not reflect current government policy in supporting families . Tax allowances of 100,000 HK $ per child can be claimed for up to 9 children . Furthermore , parents who have fallen into hardship can apply for special assistance from the state . This is a means - tested financial benefit , which is not limited to a particular number of children either . </P> <H2> Iran ( edit ) </H2> <P> Iranian authorities encouraged families in Iran not to have more than two children when conducting Family planning in Iran from early 1990s to late 2006 .

The new pieces were identical in diameter to modern cents , though somewhat thicker and made of copper - nickel . The design caused production difficulties , and the Mint soon looked to replace the coin . Mint Director James Ross Snowden selected the Indian Head design , and chose a laurel wreath for the reverse that was replaced in 1860 by an oak wreath with a shield . Cents were hoarded during the economic chaos of the American Civil War , when the metal nickel was in short supply .

That coin was intended to contain close to a cent 's worth of copper , as people then expected that coins contain close to their face values in metal . Nevertheless , because of the constitutional clause making only gold and silver legal tender , the government would not accept copper cents for taxes or other payments . By the early 1850s , fluctuations in the price of copper led the Mint of the United States ( hereafter Mint ) to seek alternatives , including reducing the size of the cent and experimenting with compositions other than pure copper . The result was the Flying Eagle cent , the same diameter as the later Lincoln cent but somewhat thicker and heavier , composed of 88 % copper and 12 % nickel . The Flying Eagle cent was struck in limited numbers as a pattern coin in 1856 , then for circulation in 1857 and 1858 . </P> <P> The Flying Eagle cent was issued in exchange for worn Spanish colonial silver coins , which until then had circulated widely in the United States . These `` small cents '' were also issued in exchange for the copper coins they had replaced . By 1858 , Mint authorities found the piece unsatisfactory in production . The high points on both sides of the coin ( the eagle 's head and the wreath ) opposed each other , and it was difficult to get the design to be brought out fully in the tough copper - nickel alloy . Mint Engraver James B. Longacre , designer of the Flying Eagle cent , was instructed to develop alternative designs . He produced one , showing a slimmer eagle , which would not clash as much with the reverse wreath . Although this would have cured the production problem , the design was not liked . Mint Director James Ross Snowden suggested a head of Columbus as an obverse design , but Longacre felt the public would not approve of a historic figure on an American coin . </P> A Spanish colonial two - reales piece ( `` two bits '' ) from the Potos\u00ed Mint ( today in Bolivia ) <P> In 1858 , the Mint tested new designs for the cent . Between 60 and 100 sets of twelve pattern coins were struck , consisting of the standard Flying Eagle obverse , a `` scrawny eagle '' pattern , and the Indian Head design , mated with four different wreaths for the reverse . Snowden would make his choice of what design would be struck in 1859 from these patterns ; the sets were also sold to collectors . The Indian Head design was apparently prepared by April , as on the twelfth of that month , a Mr. Howard wrote to Snowden that `` I have learned that a new pattern piece for the cent has been struck off at the Mint ( with ) a head resembling that of the three dollar piece and on the reverse a shield at the top of the olive and oak wreath '' , and asking to purchase a specimen .

Shepard 's illustrations . </P> <P> In 1991 , Stephen Slesinger , Inc. filed a lawsuit against Disney which alleged that Disney had breached their 1983 agreement by again failing to accurately report revenue from Winnie the Pooh sales . Under this agreement , Disney was to retain approximately 98 % of gross worldwide revenues while the remaining 2 % was to be paid to Slesinger . In addition , the suit alleged that Disney had failed to pay required royalties on all commercial exploitation of the product name . Though the Disney corporation was sanctioned by a judge for destroying forty boxes of evidential documents , the suit was later terminated by another judge when it was discovered that Slesinger 's investigator had rummaged through Disney 's garbage in order to retrieve the discarded evidence . Slesinger appealed the termination , and on 26 September 2007 , a three - judge panel upheld the lawsuit dismissal . </P> <P> After the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998 , Clare Milne , Christopher Milne 's daughter , attempted to terminate any future U.S. copyrights for Stephen Slesinger , Inc . After a series of legal hearings , Judge Florence - Marie Cooper of the US District Court in California found in favour of Stephen Slesinger , Inc. , as did the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit . On 26 June 2006 , the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case , sustaining the ruling and ensuring the defeat of the suit . </P> <P> On 19 February 2007 Disney lost a court case in Los Angeles which ruled their `` misguided claims '' to dispute the licensing agreements with Slesinger , Inc. were unjustified , but a federal ruling of 28 September 2009 , again from Judge Florence - Marie Cooper , determined that the Slesinger family had granted all trademark and copyright rights to Disney , although Disney must pay royalties for all future use of the characters . Both parties have expressed satisfaction with the outcome . </P> <H2> Adaptations </H2> <H3> Theatre </H3> <Ul> <Li> Winnie - the - Pooh at the Guild Theater Sue Hastings Marionettes , 1931 </Li> <Li> Winnie - the - Pooh , a play in three acts Dramatized by Kristin Sergel , Dramatic Publishing Company , 1957 </Li> <Li> Winnie - the - Pooh , a musical comedy in two acts Lyrics by A.A.

Shepard 's illustrations . </P> <P> In 1991 , Stephen Slesinger , Inc. filed a lawsuit against Disney which alleged that Disney had breached their 1983 agreement by again failing to accurately report revenue from Winnie the Pooh sales . Under this agreement , Disney was to retain approximately 98 % of gross worldwide revenues while the remaining 2 % was to be paid to Slesinger . In addition , the suit alleged that Disney had failed to pay required royalties on all commercial exploitation of the product name . Though the Disney corporation was sanctioned by a judge for destroying forty boxes of evidential documents , the suit was later terminated by another judge when it was discovered that Slesinger 's investigator had rummaged through Disney 's garbage in order to retrieve the discarded evidence . Slesinger appealed the termination , and on 26 September 2007 , a three - judge panel upheld the lawsuit dismissal . </P> <P> After the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998 , Clare Milne , Christopher Milne 's daughter , attempted to terminate any future U.S. copyrights for Stephen Slesinger , Inc . After a series of legal hearings , Judge Florence - Marie Cooper of the US District Court in California found in favour of Stephen Slesinger , Inc. , as did the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit . On 26 June 2006 , the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case , sustaining the ruling and ensuring the defeat of the suit . </P> <P> On 19 February 2007 Disney lost a court case in Los Angeles which ruled their `` misguided claims '' to dispute the licensing agreements with Slesinger , Inc. were unjustified , but a federal ruling of 28 September 2009 , again from Judge Florence - Marie Cooper , determined that the Slesinger family had granted all trademark and copyright rights to Disney , although Disney must pay royalties for all future use of the characters .

Although such a record was unusual for a teenage group , `` Never Can Say Goodbye '' was a # 2 hit for three consecutive weeks on the Billboard Pop Singles chart , stuck behind Three Dog Night 's `` Joy to the World '' ( May 8 - May 22 , 1971 ) , and a # 1 hit on the Billboard Black Singles chart in the United States .

This was to coincide with increasing deregulation of the private sector rental market as it was felt at the time that local authorities would have a better understanding of local rental market conditions than the DSS . Its full transfer took place in 1989 as part of a major reform of social security legislation which also saw the introduction of Income Support . </P> <H2> Concepts and terminology ( edit ) </H2> <P> Housing Benefit will only meet the pure rent costs of any liability . Central to benefit decisions is an assessment of eligible rent and ineligible services . Eligible rent is that part of the rent paid by a person which can legally be covered by housing benefit . Ineligible services are the parts of the claimant 's rent liability that he must meet himself . Ineligible services include such things as the cost of heating , lighting , water rates , meals and any general counselling and support that may be included in the rent charged but will not be met by Housing Benefit . </P> <P> The payment of the benefit is centred on the concept of a benefit week , which is a seven - day period running from a Monday to a Sunday . Housing Benefit may be paid on a weekly , fortnightly , lunar monthly or calendar monthly basis . Housing Benefit paid to landlords is usually paid four weeks in arrears . Regulations require local authorities to take into account the needs of the claimant when deciding on the frequency of benefit payments , however due to the complexity of calculating a calendar monthly payment and especially any overpayments that arise , most local authorities pay benefit fortnightly to claimants and four weekly to landlords . </P> <P> For claimants not on a `` passported benefit '' , the concept of a benefit week is particularly important as benefit will only be paid from the start of a tenancy if the form is requested on the same benefit week as moving in . In all other cases for tenants not on a passported benefit , Housing Benefit will start only from the Monday after the form was requested . If the form is returned within a month of request , otherwise benefit is payable from the Monday after the council receives it . </P> <P> Applicants who successfully apply for a passported benefit along with their Housing Benefit have a calendar month to return the Housing Benefit form , from the date of application to the passported benefit . If the form is returned within one month of that date benefit starts from the Monday after the start date of the passported benefit - even if that benefit is backdated . </P> <P> Originally using paper application forms , in recent years local authorities have begun to use a telephone - based application process . Under these latter application schemes , claimants would often contact the responsible central government department , who would then forward the details to the local authority . This has turned out to be a somewhat prescient decision ; the gateway for claimants to the new Universal Credit system , which replaces Housing Benefit , is the central government department , not local authorities . </P> <P> The date of claim will be the date the claimant you first contacted the Department for Works and Pensions , for claimants applying to the Department for Work and Pensions , and otherwise the date of claim will be treated as the date he contacted the Local Authority . </P> <H2> Benefit cap ( edit ) </H2> Main article : benefit cap <P> Due to a benefit cap many claimants have had their housing benefit reduced to 50p a week and are at risk of losing their homes if they can not pay their rent . New building providing supported housing for vulnerable people is being cut due to uncertainty whether prospective tenants will be able to pay the rent . Schemes affected include homes for war veterans , for people with learning disabilities helping them live independently . Safe housing for domestic violence victims could also be at risk . New schemes are postponed or cancelled and existing schemes are being closed . David Orr of the National Housing Federation said , `` With social care in crisis , the role supported housing plays in alleviating pressures on the NHS is ever more important . These changes have not even come in yet and they have taken 7,000 homes for vulnerable people out of the pipeline . The proposed changes in funding bear no relation to the real cost of providing this type of housing . It is time government put supported housing on a secure and sustainable footing . '' The most vulnerable people , elderly people , severely disabled people and people with mental health problems need a great deal of support and the benefit cap disproportionately pprevents them from getting what they need . </P> <P> Polly Neate of Shelter said , `` The money put forward ( by the government for social housing ) is only a fraction of what 's needed , given just how bad this crisis has become . Building new homes also takes time , and time is not on the side of the million private renters who could risk being tipped into homelessness by the freeze on housing benefit . Whether a struggling family or a young person in low - paid work , the freeze is stripping away the help people desperately need to pay their rent . ( ... ) We are urging the government to abandon the freeze on housing benefit in the autumn budget or risk making more people homeless . '' </P> <H2> Local Housing Allowance ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Local Housing Allowance <P> The Government has introduced a new rent restriction policy for the calculation of Housing Benefit for private tenants called Local Housing Allowance . The scheme replaces two previous methods of controlling high rents for most new tenancies. Old scheme cases where the local authority decided the level of restriction based on the cost of suitable alternative accommodation ( in operation from 15 January 1989 to 1 January 1996 ) , Reference Rent cases , where the level of eligible rent was decided by the Rent Service based on the lower of what a landlord would have been able to obtain had a landlord not been renting to a tenant on Housing Benefit ( the claim related rent ) and the average cost of similar properties in that area ( the local reference rent ) . </P> <P> For LHA cases the eligible rent is decided in part by the size of property a claimant needs . This figure is published monthly by the council and the Rent Service . If the tenant rents more expensive accommodation , the rent is restricted to the LHA rate for that area . By publicising how much Housing Benefit a tenant can get for the need for Pre-Tenancy Determinations is removed . </P> <P> The Local Housing Allowance is set at the 30th percentile level for rents in the Broad Market Rental Area . The Broad Market Rental areas are similar in geographic size to Counties . This has led to a number of counties such as Cambridgeshire criticising the scheme because market rents in the city area of the county are considerably higher than those in the shire areas of the county . The House of Lords ruled against the concept of very large Broad Market Rental areas in the Heffernan case ( R ( Heffernan ) v The Rent Service ( 2008 ) UKHL 58 ) . The DWP re-introduced legislation to overturn this decision , restoring its intention to use very large broad market rental areas to draw down the cost of the scheme . </P> <P> Local Housing Allowance was introduced across all Local Authority areas on 7 April 2008 .

The term ZIP is an acronym for Zone Improvement Plan ; it was chosen to suggest that the mail travels more efficiently and quickly ( zipping along ) when senders use the code in the postal address . The basic format consists of five digits . An extended ' ZIP + 4 ' code was introduced in 1983 which includes the five digits of the ZIP Code , followed by a hyphen and four additional digits that determine a more specific location . </P> <P> The term ZIP Code was originally registered as a servicemark by the U.S. Postal Service , but its registration has since expired . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Early history and five - digit ZIP Codes </Li> <Li> 1.2 ZIP + 4 </Li> <Li> 1.3 Postal bar code </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Structure and allocation <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Scope and international mail </Li> <Li> 2.2 By type and use </Li> <Li> 2.3 By geography <Ul> <Li> 2.3. 1 Primary state prefixes </Li> <Li> 2.3. 2 Secondary regional prefixes ( 123xx ) and local ZIP Codes ( 12345 ) </Li> <Li> 2.3. 3 ZIP Codes and previous zoning lines </Li> <Li> 2.3. 4 Division and reallocation of ZIP codes </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Other uses <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Delivery services </Li> <Li> 3.2 Statistics </Li> <Li> 3.3 Marketing </Li> <Li> 3.4 Legislative districts </Li> <Li> 3.5 Internet </Li> <Li> 3.6 Credit card security </Li> <Li> 3.7 Insurance rating </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 See also </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Early History and five - digit ZIP Codes ( edit ) </H3> A 1963 U.S. Post Office sign <P> The early history and context of postal codes began with postal district / zone numbers . The United States Post Office Department ( USPOD ) implemented postal zones for numerous large cities in 1943 . For example : </P> <P> Mr. John Smith </P> <P> 3256 Epiphenomenal Avenue </P> Minneapolis 16 , Minnesota <P> The `` 16 '' was the number of the postal zone from the specific city . </P> <P> By the early 1960s , a more organized system was needed , and non-mandatory five - digit ZIP Codes were introduced nationwide on July 1 , 1963 . The USPOD issued its Publication 59 : Abbreviations for Use with ZIP Code on October 1 , 1963 , with the list of two - letter state abbreviations which are generally written with both letters capitalized . An earlier list in June had proposed capitalized abbreviations ranging from two to five letters . According to Publication 59 , the two - letter standard was `` based on a maximum 23 - position line , because this has been found to be the most universally acceptable line capacity basis for major addressing systems '' , which would be exceeded by a long city name combined with a multi-letter state abbreviation , such as `` Sacramento , Calif . '' along with the ZIP Code . The abbreviations have remained unchanged , with the exception of Nebraska , which was changed from NB to NE in 1969 at the request of the Canadian postal administration , to avoid confusion with the Canadian province of New Brunswick . </P> <P> Robert Moon is considered the father of the ZIP Code ; he submitted his proposal in 1944 while working as a postal inspector . The post office only credits Moon with the first three digits of the ZIP Code , which describe the sectional center facility ( SCF ) or `` sec center . '' An SCF is a central mail processing facility with those three digits . The SCF sorts mail to all post offices with those first three digits in their ZIP Codes . The mail is sorted according to the final two digits of the ZIP Code and sent to the corresponding post offices in the early morning . Sectional centers do not deliver mail and are not open to the public ( though the building may include a post office open to the public ) , and most of their employees work night shift . Mail picked up at post offices is sent to their own SCF in the afternoon , where the mail is sorted overnight . In the cases of large cities , the last two digits coincide with the older postal zone number thus : </P> <P> Mr. John Smith </P> <P> 3256 Epiphenomenal Avenue </P> Minneapolis , MN 55416 <P> In 1967 , these became mandatory for second and third - class bulk mailers , and the system was soon adopted generally . The United States Post Office used a cartoon character which it called Mr. ZIP to promote the use of the ZIP Code . He was often depicted with a legend such as `` USE ZIP CODE '' in the selvage of panes of postage stamps or on the covers of booklet panes of stamps . </P> <P> In 1971 Elmira ( NY ) Star Gazette reporter Dick Baumbach found out the White House was not using a zip code on its envelopes . Herb Klein , special assistant to President Nixon , responded by saying the next printing of envelopes would include the zip code . That did occur . </P> <H3> ZIP + 4 ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 1983 , the U.S. Postal Service introduced an expanded ZIP Code system that it called ZIP + 4 , often called `` plus - four codes '' , `` add - on codes '' , or `` add - ons '' .

The term ZIP is an acronym for Zone Improvement Plan ; it was chosen to suggest that the mail travels more efficiently and quickly ( zipping along ) when senders use the code in the postal address . The basic format consists of five digits . An extended ' ZIP + 4 ' code was introduced in 1983 which includes the five digits of the ZIP Code , followed by a hyphen and four additional digits that determine a more specific location . </P> <P> The term ZIP Code was originally registered as a servicemark by the U.S. Postal Service , but its registration has since expired . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Early history and five - digit ZIP Codes </Li> <Li> 1.2 ZIP + 4 </Li> <Li> 1.3 Postal bar code </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Structure and allocation <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Scope and international mail </Li> <Li> 2.2 By type and use </Li> <Li> 2.3 By geography <Ul> <Li> 2.3. 1 Primary state prefixes </Li> <Li> 2.3. 2 Secondary regional prefixes ( 123xx ) and local ZIP Codes ( 12345 ) </Li> <Li> 2.3. 3 ZIP Codes and previous zoning lines </Li> <Li> 2.3. 4 Division and reallocation of ZIP codes </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Other uses <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Delivery services </Li> <Li> 3.2 Statistics </Li> <Li> 3.3 Marketing </Li> <Li> 3.4 Legislative districts </Li> <Li> 3.5 Internet </Li> <Li> 3.6 Credit card security </Li> <Li> 3.7 Insurance rating </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 See also </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Early History and five - digit ZIP Codes ( edit ) </H3> A 1963 U.S. Post Office sign <P> The early history and context of postal codes began with postal district / zone numbers . The United States Post Office Department ( USPOD ) implemented postal zones for numerous large cities in 1943 . For example : </P> <P> Mr. John Smith </P> <P> 3256 Epiphenomenal Avenue </P> Minneapolis 16 , Minnesota <P> The `` 16 '' was the number of the postal zone from the specific city . </P> <P> By the early 1960s , a more organized system was needed , and non-mandatory five - digit ZIP Codes were introduced nationwide on July 1 , 1963 . The USPOD issued its Publication 59 : Abbreviations for Use with ZIP Code on October 1 , 1963 , with the list of two - letter state abbreviations which are generally written with both letters capitalized . An earlier list in June had proposed capitalized abbreviations ranging from two to five letters . According to Publication 59 , the two - letter standard was `` based on a maximum 23 - position line , because this has been found to be the most universally acceptable line capacity basis for major addressing systems '' , which would be exceeded by a long city name combined with a multi-letter state abbreviation , such as `` Sacramento , Calif . '' along with the ZIP Code . The abbreviations have remained unchanged , with the exception of Nebraska , which was changed from NB to NE in 1969 at the request of the Canadian postal administration , to avoid confusion with the Canadian province of New Brunswick . </P> <P> Robert Moon is considered the father of the ZIP Code ; he submitted his proposal in 1944 while working as a postal inspector . The post office only credits Moon with the first three digits of the ZIP Code , which describe the sectional center facility ( SCF ) or `` sec center . '' An SCF is a central mail processing facility with those three digits . The SCF sorts mail to all post offices with those first three digits in their ZIP Codes . The mail is sorted according to the final two digits of the ZIP Code and sent to the corresponding post offices in the early morning . Sectional centers do not deliver mail and are not open to the public ( though the building may include a post office open to the public ) , and most of their employees work night shift . Mail picked up at post offices is sent to their own SCF in the afternoon , where the mail is sorted overnight . In the cases of large cities , the last two digits coincide with the older postal zone number thus : </P> <P> Mr. John Smith </P> <P> 3256 Epiphenomenal Avenue </P> Minneapolis , MN 55416 <P> In 1967 , these became mandatory for second and third - class bulk mailers , and the system was soon adopted generally . The United States Post Office used a cartoon character which it called Mr. ZIP to promote the use of the ZIP Code . He was often depicted with a legend such as `` USE ZIP CODE '' in the selvage of panes of postage stamps or on the covers of booklet panes of stamps . </P> <P> In 1971 Elmira ( NY ) Star Gazette reporter Dick Baumbach found out the White House was not using a zip code on its envelopes . Herb Klein , special assistant to President Nixon , responded by saying the next printing of envelopes would include the zip code . That did occur . </P> <H3> ZIP + 4 ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 1983 , the U.S. Postal Service introduced an expanded ZIP Code system that it called ZIP + 4 , often called `` plus - four codes '' , `` add - on codes '' , or `` add - ons '' . A ZIP + 4 Code uses the basic five - digit code plus four additional digits to identify a geographic segment within the five - digit delivery area , such as a city block , a group of apartments , an individual high - volume receiver of mail , a post office box , or any other unit that could use an extra identifier to aid in efficient mail sorting and delivery . However , initial attempts to promote universal use of the new format met with public resistance and today the plus - four code is not required . In general , mail is read by a multiline optical character reader ( MLOCR ) that almost instantly determines the correct ZIP + 4 Code from the address -- along with the even more specific delivery point -- and sprays an Intelligent Mail barcode ( IM ) on the face of the mail piece that corresponds to 11 digits -- nine for the ZIP + 4 Code and two for the delivery point . </P> <P> For Post Office Boxes , the general ( but not invariable ) rule is that each box has its own ZIP + 4 code . The add - on code is often one of the following : the last four digits of the box number ( e.g. PO Box 107050 , Albany , NY 12201 - 7050 ) , zero plus the last three digits of the box number ( e.g. , PO Box 17727 , Eagle River , AK 99577 - 0727 ) , or , if the box number consists of fewer than four digits , enough zeros are attached to the front of the box number to produce a four - digit number ( e.g. , PO Box 77 , Juneau , AK 99750 - 0077 ) .

It was a fortuitous turn of events , where the idea for a show was being considered , and then here comes a real life story that helped give it some shape . </Td> <Td> '' </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> NBC bought the rights to The Blacklist from Sony Pictures Television in August 2012 and greenlighted the show in January 2013 . During an NBC upfront presentation in May 2013 , it was announced that The Blacklist was NBC 's highest - testing drama in 10 years . </P> <H3> Casting ( edit ) </H3> <P> Eisendrath said the casting process was difficult . In February 2013 , NBC offered Kiefer Sutherland the lead role of Raymond Reddington . After considering other actors for the role , Eisendrath and Bokenkamp called James Spader to see if he would be interested in it . Feeling confident in Spader 's understanding of the character , they cast him three days before filming began . </P> <P> Megan Boone took a week to prepare for her audition as FBI profiler Elizabeth Keen . Feeling like her initial audition was one of the better auditions of her career , Boone later was called back for multiple auditions . In March 2013 , Deadline Hollywood reported that Boone accepted the role as the female lead in the series . </P> <H3> Filming locations and technique ( edit ) </H3> <P> Despite being set in Washington , D.C. , the series is mainly filmed in the same Manhattan studio where Law & Order was filmed for 20 years . Producer Richard Heus said they chose to film specific Washington , D.C. locations for the series , including the Lincoln Memorial , the Washington Monument , and the National Mall , because they were `` iconic American locations '' . </P> <P> The series is filmed in 4K using Sony PMW - F55 cameras that are adapted to use Panavision lenses . It is edited using Avid Media Composer , and editor Christopher Brookshire says the show has `` a very distinctive look and pace '' . An average of three cameras are used at one time , but as many as six cameras are sometimes rolling . </P> <H2> Broadcast ( edit ) </H2> <P> The series is broadcast simultaneously on Global in Canada . In New Zealand , the show premiered on TV3 on February 2 , 2014 . The second season premiered on September 23 . In the United Kingdom and Ireland , the show premiered on Sky Living on October 4 , 2013 . The second season premiered on October 3 , 2014 . Netflix has streaming rights to seasons 1 -- 5 in the United States , 1 -- 4 in Australia , Latin America , Finland , Switzerland , Germany , Sweden , The Netherlands , and Canada . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Critical response ( edit ) </H3> <P> The first season of The Blacklist received strong reviews from television critics . On Metacritic , the first season has a score of 74 out of 100 , based on 31 critics , indicating `` generally favorable reviews '' . The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an 85 % approval rating , based on 52 reviews , with an average score of 7.18 / 10 . The consensus reads , `` James Spader is riveting as a criminal - turned - informant , and his presence goes a long way toward making this twisty but occasionally implausible crime procedural compelling '' . The second season received a rating of 80 % , based on 15 reviews , with an average score of 7.77 / 10 . The consensus reads , `` Though The Blacklist flirts with narrative overload , it 's held together by James Spader 's scenery - eating performance and wildly entertaining action . '' The third season received a rating of 93 % , based on 14 reviews , with an average score of 7.41 / 10 . The consensus reads , `` The Blacklist is back in top form with fresh dangers that put Red on the ropes while giving James Spader room to shine . '' The fo? \nAnswer: ", "answer": "5"}

The First Treatise attacks patriarchalism in the form of sentence - by - sentence refutation of Robert Filmer 's Patriarcha , while the Second Treatise outlines Locke 's ideas for a more civilized society based on natural rights and contract theory . </P> <P> This publication contrasts former political works by Locke himself . In Two Tracts on Government , written in 1660 , Locke defends a very conservative position ; however Locke never published it . In 1669 Locke co-authored the Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina , which endorses aristocracy , slavery and serfdom . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Historical context </Li> <Li> 2 Publication history </Li> <Li> 3 Main ideas </Li> <Li> 4 First Treatise </Li> <Li> 5 Second Treatise <Ul> <Li> 5.1 State of nature </Li> <Li> 5.2 Conquest and slavery </Li> <Li> 5.3 Property </Li> <Li> 5.4 Representative government </Li> <Li> 5.5 Right of revolution </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Reception and influence <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Britain </Li> <Li> 6.2 North America </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 Controversies regarding interpretation </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Historical context ( edit ) </H2> <P> King James II of England ( VII of Scotland ) was overthrown in 1688 by a union of Parliamentarians and the stadtholder of the Dutch Republic William III of Oranje - Nassau ( William of Orange ) , who as a result ascended the English throne as William III of England . This is known as the Glorious Revolution , also called the Revolution of 1688 . Locke claims in the `` Preface '' to the Two Treatises that its purpose is to justify William III 's ascension to the throne , though Peter Laslett suggests that the bulk of the writing was instead completed between 1679 -- 1680 ( and subsequently revised until Locke was driven into exile in 1683 ) . According to Laslett , Locke was writing his Two Treatises during the Exclusion Crisis , which attempted to prevent James II from ever taking the throne in the first place . Anthony Ashley - Cooper , 1st Earl of Shaftesbury , Locke 's mentor , patron and friend , introduced the bill , but it was ultimately unsuccessful . Richard Ashcraft , following in Laslett 's suggestion that the Two Treatises were written before the Revolution , objected that Shaftesbury 's party did not advocate revolution during the Exclusion Crisis . He suggests that they are instead better associated with the revolutionary conspiracies that swirled around what would come to be known as the Rye House Plot . Locke , Shaftesbury and many others were forced into exile ; some , such as Sidney , were even executed for treason . Locke knew his work was dangerous -- he never acknowledged his authorship within his lifetime . </P> <H2> Publication history ( edit ) </H2> The only edition of the Treatises published in America during the 18th century ( 1773 ) <P> Two Treatises was first published , anonymously , in December 1689 ( following printing conventions of the time , its title page was marked 1690 ) . Locke was unhappy with this edition , complaining to the publisher about its many errors . For the rest of his life , he was intent on republishing the Two Treatises in a form that better reflected his meaning . Peter Laslett , one of the foremost Locke scholars , has suggested that Locke held the printers to a higher `` standard of perfection '' than the technology of the time would permit . Be that as it may , the first edition was indeed replete with errors . The second edition was even worse , and finally printed on cheap paper and sold to the poor . The third edition was much improved , but Locke was still not satisfied . He made corrections to the third edition by hand and entrusted the publication of the fourth to his friends , as he died before it could be brought out . </P> <P> The Two Treatises begin with a Preface announcing what Locke hopes to achieve , but he also mentions that more than half of his original draft , occupying a space between the First and Second Treatises , has been irretrievably lost . Peter Laslett maintains that , while Locke may have added or altered some portions in 1689 , he did not make any revisions to accommodate for the missing section ; he argues , for example , that the end of the First Treatise breaks off in mid-sentence . </P> <P> In 1691 Two Treatises was translated into French by David Mazzel , a French Huguenot living in the Netherlands . This translation left out Locke 's `` Preface , '' all of the First Treatise , and the first chapter of the Second Treatise ( which summarised Locke 's conclusions in the First Treatise ) . It was in this form that Locke 's work was reprinted during the 18th century in France and in this form that Montesquieu , Voltaire and Rousseau were exposed to it . The only American edition from the 18th century was printed in 1773 in Boston ; it , too , left out all of these sections . There were no other American editions until the 20th century . </P> <H2> Main ideas ( edit ) </H2> <P> Two Treatises is divided into the First Treatise and the Second Treatise . The original title of the Second Treatise appears to have been simply `` Book II , '' corresponding to the title of the First Treatise , `` Book I . '' Before publication , however , Locke gave it greater prominence by ( hastily ) inserting a separate title page : `` An Essay Concerning the True Original , Extent and End of Civil Government . '' The First Treatise is focused on the refutation of Sir Robert Filmer , in particular his Patriarcha , which argued that civil society was founded on a divinely sanctioned patriarchalism . Locke proceeds through Filmer 's arguments , contesting his proofs from Scripture and ridiculing them as senseless , until concluding that no government can be justified by an appeal to the divine right of kings . </P> <P> The Second Treatise outlines a theory of civil society . Locke begins by describing the state of nature , a picture much more stable than Thomas Hobbes ' state of `` war of every man against every man , '' and argues that all men are created equal in the state of nature by God . From this , he goes on to explain the hypothetical rise of property and civilization , in the process explaining that the only legitimate governments are those that have the consent of the people . Therefore , any government that rules without the consent of the people can , in theory , be overthrown . </P> <H2> First Treatise ( edit ) </H2> Title page from Filmer 's Patriarcha ( 1680 ) <P> The First Treatise is an extended attack on Sir Robert Filmer 's Patriarcha .

The Latter Is an Essay Concerning The True Original , Extent , and End of Civil Government ) is a work of political philosophy published anonymously in 1689 by John Locke . The First Treatise attacks patriarchalism in the form of sentence - by - sentence refutation of Robert Filmer 's Patriarcha , while the Second Treatise outlines Locke 's ideas for a more civilized society based on natural rights and contract theory . </P> <P> This publication contrasts former political works by Locke himself . In Two Tracts on Government , written in 1660 , Locke defends a very conservative position ; however Locke never published it . In 1669 Locke co-authored the Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina , which endorses aristocracy , slavery and serfdom . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Historical context </Li> <Li> 2 Publication history </Li> <Li> 3 Main ideas </Li> <Li> 4 First Treatise </Li> <Li> 5 Second Treatise <Ul> <Li> 5.1 State of nature </Li> <Li> 5.2 Conquest and slavery </Li> <Li> 5.3 Property </Li> <Li> 5.4 Representative government </Li> <Li> 5.5 Right of revolution </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Reception and influence <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Britain </Li> <Li> 6.2 North America </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 Controversies regarding interpretation </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Historical context ( edit ) </H2> <P> King James II of England ( VII of Scotland ) was overthrown in 1688 by a union of Parliamentarians and the stadtholder of the Dutch Republic William III of Oranje - Nassau ( William of Orange ) , who as a result ascended the English throne as William III of England . This is known as the Glorious Revolution , also called the Revolution of 1688 . Locke claims in the `` Preface '' to the Two Treatises that its purpose is to justify William III 's ascension to the throne , though Peter Laslett suggests that the bulk of the writing was instead completed between 1679 -- 1680 ( and subsequently revised until Locke was driven into exile in 1683 ) . According to Laslett , Locke was writing his Two Treatises during the Exclusion Crisis , which attempted to prevent James II from ever taking the throne in the first place . Anthony Ashley - Cooper , 1st Earl of Shaftesbury , Locke 's mentor , patron and friend , introduced the bill , but it was ultimately unsuccessful . Richard Ashcraft , following in Laslett 's suggestion that the Two Treatises were written before the Revolution , objected that Shaftesbury 's party did not advocate revolution during the Exclusion Crisis . He suggests that they are instead better associated with the revolutionary conspiracies that swirled around what would come to be known as the Rye House Plot . Locke , Shaftesbury and many others were forced into exile ; some , such as Sidney , were even executed for treason . Locke knew his work was dangerous -- he never acknowledged his authorship within his lifetime . </P> <H2> Publication history ( edit ) </H2> The only edition of the Treatises published in America during the 18th century ( 1773 ) <P> Two Treatises was first published , anonymously , in December 1689 ( following printing conventions of the time , its title page was marked 1690 ) . Locke was unhappy with this edition , complaining to the publisher about its many errors . For the rest of his life , he was intent on republishing the Two Treatises in a form that better reflected his meaning . Peter Laslett , one of the foremost Locke scholars , has suggested that Locke held the printers to a higher `` standard of perfection '' than the technology of the time would permit . Be that as it may , the first edition was indeed replete with errors . The second edition was even worse , and finally printed on cheap paper and sold to the poor . The third edition was much improved , but Locke was still not satisfied . He made corrections to the third edition by hand and entrusted the publication of the fourth to his friends , as he died before it could be brought out . </P> <P> The Two Treatises begin with a Preface announcing what Locke hopes to achieve , but he also mentions that more than half of his original draft , occupying a space between the First and Second Treatises , has been irretrievably lost . Peter Laslett maintains that , while Locke may have added or altered some portions in 1689 , he did not make any revisions to accommodate for the missing section ; he argues , for example , that the end of the First Treatise breaks off in mid-sentence . </P> <P> In 1691 Two Treatises was translated into French by David Mazzel , a French Huguenot living in the Netherlands . This translation left out Locke 's `` Preface , '' all of the First Treatise , and the first chapter of the Second Treatise ( which summarised Locke 's conclusions in the First Treatise ) . It was in this form that Locke 's work was reprinted during the 18th century in France and in this form that Montesquieu , Voltaire and Rousseau were exposed to it .

The game 's general principles put it into the Crazy Eights family of card games . The game was originally developed in 1971 by Merle Robbins in Reading , Ohio , a suburb of Cincinnati . It has been a Mattel brand since 1992 . When his family and friends began to play more and more , he spent $8,000 to have 5,000 copies of the game made . He sold it from his barbershop at first , and local businesses began to sell it as well . Robins later sold the rights to UNO to a group of friends headed by Robert Tezak , a funeral parlor owner in Joliet , Illinois , for $50,000 plus royalties of 10 cents per game .

The game 's general principles put it into the Crazy Eights family of card games . The game was originally developed in 1971 by Merle Robbins in Reading , Ohio , a suburb of Cincinnati . It has been a Mattel brand since 1992 . When his family and friends began to play more and more , he spent $8,000 to have 5,000 copies of the game made . He sold it from his barbershop at first , and local businesses began to sell it as well . Robins later sold the rights to UNO to a group of friends headed by Robert Tezak , a funeral parlor owner in Joliet , Illinois , for $50,000 plus royalties of 10 cents per game . Tezak formed International Games , Inc. , to market UNO , with offices behind his funeral parlor . The games were produced by Lewis Saltzman of Saltzman Printers in Maywood , Illinois . In 1992 , International Games became part of the Mattel family of companies. There can be 2 - 10 players . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Official rules <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Penalties </Li> <Li> 1.2 Two - player game </Li> <Li> 1.3 House rules </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Strategies </Li> <Li> 3 Card and deck styles </Li> <Li> 4 Theme packs <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Themed My First Uno games </Li> <Li> 4.2 Themed video games </Li> <Li> 4.3 Themed sports teams </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Special Uno games </Li> <Li> 6 Video games </Li> <Li> 7 Variations </Li> <Li> 8 UNO : Slots </Li> <Li> 9 UNO : The Game Show </Li> <Li> 10 Similar games </Li> <Li> 11 Notes </Li> <Li> 12 References </Li> <Li> 13 Bibliography </Li> </Ul> <H2> Official rules ( edit ) </H2> Uno cards Uno cards UNO cards deck <P> The aim of the game is to be the first player to score 500 points , achieved ( usually over several rounds of play ) by a player discarding all of their cards and earning points corresponding to the value of the remaining cards still held by the other players . Action cards ( Skip , Draw Two and Reverse ) are worth 20 Points while Wild and Wild Draw Four cards are worth 50 Points . </P> <P> The deck consists of 108 cards , of which there are 25 of each color ( red , green , blue , and yellow ) , each color having two of each rank except zero . The ranks in each color are zero to nine , `` Skip '' , `` Draw Two '' , and `` Reverse '' ( the last three being `` action cards '' ) . In addition , the deck contains four each of `` Wild '' and `` Wild Draw Four '' cards . </P> <P> To start a hand , seven cards are dealt to each player , with the top card of the deck flipped over and set aside to begin the discard pile . The player to the dealer 's left plays first unless the first card on the discard pile is an action or Wild card ( see below ) .

The third U.S. President ( 1801 -- 09 ) , Thomas Jefferson , is featured on the obverse of the note . The reverse features an engraving of the painting The Declaration of Independence by John Trumbull . Throughout the $2 bill 's pre-1929 life as a large - sized note , it was issued as a United States Note , National Bank Note , silver certificate , Treasury or `` Coin '' Note and Federal Reserve Bank Note . When U.S. currency was changed to its current size , the $2 bill was issued only as a United States Note . Production went on until 1966 , when the series was discontinued . Ten years passed before the $2 bill was reissued as a Federal Reserve Note with a new reverse design . Two - dollar bills are seldom seen in circulation as a result of banking policies with businesses which has resulted in low production numbers due to lack of demand . This comparative scarcity in circulation , coupled with a lack of public knowledge that the bill is still in production and circulation , has also inspired urban legends about its authenticity and value and has occasionally created problems for those trying to use the bill to make purchases . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Denomination overview </Li> <Li> 2 Rarity </Li> <Li> 3 History <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Large - sized notes </Li> <Li> 3.2 Small size notes <Ul> <Li> 3.2. 1 1928 -- 1966 </Li> <Li> 3.2. 2 1976 -- present </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3.3 Series dates <Ul> <Li> 3.3. 1 Large size </Li> <Li> 3.3. 2 Small size </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Visual snapshot </Li> <Li> 5 Usage <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Incidents </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Uncut currency sheets </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Denomination overview ( edit ) </H2> <P> The denomination of two dollars was authorized under a congressional act , and first used in March 1862 . The denomination was continuously used until the 1960s ; by this time the United States Note was the only remaining class of U.S. currency the two - dollar bill was assigned to . In 1966 it was decided to discontinue production of all United States Notes , which included the two - dollar bill . The two - dollar denomination was not immediately reassigned to the Federal Reserve Note class of United States currency and was thus fully discontinued ; the Treasury Department cited the two - dollar bill 's low use and unpopularity as the reason for not immediately resuming use of the denomination . In 1976 , production of the two - dollar denomination was resumed and the two - dollar bill was finally assigned as a Federal Reserve Note , with a new reverse design featuring John Trumbull 's depiction of the drafting of the United States Declaration of Independence replacing the previous design of Monticello . It has remained a current denomination since then . It was estimated that if the two - dollar bill replaced approximately half of the one - dollar bills in circulation , the federal government would be able to save about $26 million in 1976 dollars ( $112 million adjusted for inflation ) over the period from 1976 to 1981 , due to reduced production , storage , and shipping costs . </P> <P> However , due to their limited use , two - dollar bills are not printed as frequently in a new series as other denominations , which are produced according to demand . Some bill acceptors found in vending machines , self checkout lanes , and other automated kiosks are configured to accommodate two - dollar bills , even if the fact is not stated on the label .

This comparative scarcity in circulation , coupled with a lack of public knowledge that the bill is still in production and circulation , has also inspired urban legends about its authenticity and value and has occasionally created problems for those trying to use the bill to make purchases . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Denomination overview </Li> <Li> 2 Rarity </Li> <Li> 3 History <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Large - sized notes </Li> <Li> 3.2 Small size notes <Ul> <Li> 3.2. 1 1928 -- 1966 </Li> <Li> 3.2. 2 1976 -- present </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3.3 Series dates <Ul> <Li> 3.3. 1 Large size </Li> <Li> 3.3. 2 Small size </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Visual snapshot </Li> <Li> 5 Usage <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Incidents </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Uncut currency sheets </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Denomination overview ( edit ) </H2> <P> The denomination of two dollars was authorized under a congressional act , and first used in March 1862 . The denomination was continuously used until the 1960s ; by this time the United States Note was the only remaining class of U.S. currency the two - dollar bill was assigned to . In 1966 it was decided to discontinue production of all United States Notes , which included the two - dollar bill . The two - dollar denomination was not immediately reassigned to the Federal Reserve Note class of United States currency and was thus fully discontinued ; the Treasury Department cited the two - dollar bill 's low use and unpopularity as the reason for not immediately resuming use of the denomination . In 1976 , production of the two - dollar denomination was resumed and the two - dollar bill was finally assigned as a Federal Reserve Note , with a new reverse design featuring John Trumbull 's depiction of the drafting of the United States Declaration of Independence replacing the previous design of Monticello . It has remained a current denomination since then . It was estimated that if the two - dollar bill replaced approximately half of the one - dollar bills in circulation , the federal government would be able to save about $26 million in 1976 dollars ( $112 million adjusted for inflation ) over the period from 1976 to 1981 , due to reduced production , storage , and shipping costs . </P> <P> However , due to their limited use , two - dollar bills are not printed as frequently in a new series as other denominations , which are produced according to demand . Some bill acceptors found in vending machines , self checkout lanes , and other automated kiosks are configured to accommodate two - dollar bills , even if the fact is not stated on the label . Although they are generally available at most banks , two - dollar bills are usually not handed out except upon specific request by the customer , and may cause a delay with a trip to the vault . </P> <H2> Rarity ( edit ) </H2> <P> Printing $2 bills is twice as cost - effective for the government as printing $1 bills , since they both cost the same amount ( about $0.05 ) to make , but the public has not circulated them as widely . During the Great Depression , few Americans had enough money to require $2 bills . In the middle of the 20th century , $2 bills were commonly used at strip clubs , for betting on horse racing , and for bribery when politicians wanted votes ( though this may be an urban legend ) and so acquired a negative reputation . The unusual reverse design of the 1976 note contributed to hoarding , and combined with the earlier discontinuation to give the impression these notes might be valuable as collector 's items , above their face value . The public at large continues to be unfamiliar with the notes because they are not being circulated widely . </P> <P> Today , there is a common misconception by the general public that the $2 bill is no longer being produced , though bills have been printed in 1996 , 1997 , 2004 , 2006 , 2012 , and 2013 .

The phrase has been incorporated in many hymns and religious - patriotic songs . During the American Civil War , the 125th Pennsylvania Infantry for the Union Army assumed the motto `` In God we trust '' in early August 1862 . William W.

Watkinson of ' Ridleyville ' , Pennsylvania , ( pastor of Prospect Hill Baptist Church in present - day Prospect Park , Pennsylvania ) in a letter dated November 13 , 1861 , petitioned the Treasury Department to add a statement recognizing `` Almighty God in some form on our coins '' in order to `` relieve us from the ignominy of heathenism '' . At least part of the motivation was to declare that God was on the Union side of the Civil War . Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase acted on this proposal and directed the then - Philadelphia Director of the Mint , James Pollock , to begin drawing up possible designs that would include the religious phrase . Chase chose his favorite designs and presented a proposal to Congress for the new designs in late 1863 . </P> <P> In December 1863 , Abraham Lincoln 's Secretary of the Treasury decided on a new motto , `` In God We Trust , '' to engrave on U.S. coins .

This meant that the mint could make no changes without the enactment of additional legislation by the Congress . Such legislation was introduced and passed as the Coinage Act of 1864 on April 22 , 1864 , allowing the Secretary of the Treasury to authorize the inclusion of the phrase on one - cent and two - cent coins . </P> <P> An Act of Congress passed on March 3 , 1865 , allowed the Mint Director , with the Secretary 's approval , to place the motto on all gold and silver coins that `` shall admit the inscription thereon '' . In 1873 , Congress passed the Coinage Act , granting that the Secretary of the Treasury `` may cause the motto IN GOD WE TRUST to be inscribed on such coins as shall admit of such motto '' . </P> <P> The similar phrase ' In God is our Trust ' appears in `` The Star - Spangled Banner '' , adopted as the national anthem of the United States in 1931 .

Ligamentum inguinale . <P> The first efficient inguinal hernia repair was described by Edoardo Bassini in the 1880s . The Bassini technique is a `` tension '' repair , in which the edges of the defect are sewn back together , without any mesh . In the Bassini technique , the conjoint tendon ( formed by the distal ends of the transversus abdominis and internal oblique muscles ) is approximated to the inguinal ligament and closed . Today , Bassini 's main interest is historical . It remains performed in some developing countries , if surgeons do not have knowledge of the mosquito - net alternative to commercial meshes in Lichtenstein repair , or if they ignore more efficient suture - based repairs . </P> McVay / Cooper 's ligament ( edit ) <P> The floor of the canal is reinforced by approximating the transversus abdominal aponeurosis and transverse fascia to pectineal ( Cooper 's ) ligament medially from the pubic tubercle to the femoral vein . Lateral to this the floor is restored by approximating the femoral sheath to the inguinal ligament . It is also used in femoral hernia repairs . </P> Shouldice ( edit ) <P> The Shouldice technique is the mainstream suture - based repair . It is a relatively difficult four layer reconstruction of fascia transversalis ; however , it has relatively low reported recurrence rates in the hand of a surgeon experienced with this method . </P> <P> Shouldice repairs are less commonly used today than in previous years , especially in developed countries . This is mostly due to the fact that mesh - based Lichtenstein method is easier to perform . The Shouldice repair has a higher rate of hernia recurrence in the hands of surgeons inexperienced with them ( < 200 operations / year ) . Another drawback is the post-operative pain due to the tension on muscles , which generally lasts some weeks . However , this pain is well - managed with analgesics , and this? \nAnswer: ", "answer": "1999"}

( later known as Rankin / Bass Productions ) and currently distributed by Universal Television . It first aired Sunday , December 6 , 1964 , on the NBC television network in the United States , and was sponsored by General Electric under the umbrella title of The General Electric Fantasy Hour . The special was based on the Johnny Marks song `` Rudolph the Red - Nosed Reindeer '' which was itself based on the poem of the same name written in 1939 by Marks ' brother - in - law , Robert L. May . Since 1972 , the special has aired on CBS , with the network unveiling a high - definition , digitally remastered version of the program in 2005 . As with A Charlie Brown Christmas and How the Grinch Stole Christmas , Rudolph no longer airs just once annually , but several times during the Christmas and holiday season on CBS . Unlike other holiday specials that also air on several cable channels ( including Freeform ) , Rudolph only airs on CBS . It has been telecast every year since 1964 , making it the longest continuously running Christmas TV special in history . 2014 marked the 50th anniversary of the television special and a series of postage stamps featuring Rudolph was issued by the United States Postal Service on November 6 , 2014 . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot </Li> <Li> 2 Cast </Li> <Li> 3 Production <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Aftermath </Li> <Li> 3.2 Production credits </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Different versions <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Original 1964 NBC broadcast edit </Li> <Li> 4.2 1965 -- 1997 telecasts </Li> <Li> 4.3 1998 -- CBS telecasts </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Home media </Li> <Li> 6 Soundtrack </Li> <Li> 7 Merchandise </Li> <Li> 8 Reception </Li> <Li> 9 Sequels </Li> <Li> 10 In popular culture <Ul> <Li> 10.1 Films by Corky Quakenbush </Li> <Li> 10.2 Uses in advertising </Li> <Li> 10.3 Other References </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 11 Copyright issues </Li> <Li> 12 See also </Li> <Li> 13 References </Li> <Li> 14 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Plot ( edit ) </H2> <P> Sam the Snowman welcomes the viewers to Christmastown at the North Pole and introduces Santa and Mrs. Claus who live in a castle located north of the Christmas Tree Forest . Mrs. Claus fusses over Santa as she wants him to fatten up by Christmas Eve . Sam then recalls the year Christmas was almost cancelled due to a snowstorm and tells the story of how a very special reindeer saved the day . </P> <P> Donner , Santa 's lead reindeer , and his wife have given birth to their new baby fawn , Rudolph . Upon admiring him , they are surprised to see that Rudolph has been born with a glowing red nose . When Santa arrives , he warns Donner that Rudolph will not make the sleigh team because of his nose . Donner then decides to hide the nose by covering it with mud to allow Rudolph to fit in with all the other reindeer . </P> <P> Over Rudolph 's first year of life , Donner trains him in the basics of being a reindeer , including hiding from the Abominable Snow Monster of the North . Rudolph enters the reindeer games , competing against his fellow fawns . During flight practice , Rudolph meets a doe named Clarice who tells him he is cute , and kisses him , which causes an elated Rudolph to fly higher and faster than everyone else . However , while celebrating with the other bucks , Rudolph 's nose cover pops off , and the others react with fear , then scorn and finally rejection as Rudolph is kicked out of the Reindeer Games . Walking away , Rudolph walks with Clarice , who supports him , until her father firmly tells her to never have any more contacts with a red - nosed reindeer .

( later known as Rankin / Bass Productions ) and currently distributed by Universal Television . It first aired Sunday , December 6 , 1964 , on the NBC television network in the United States , and was sponsored by General Electric under the umbrella title of The General Electric Fantasy Hour . The special was based on the Johnny Marks song `` Rudolph the Red - Nosed Reindeer '' which was itself based on the poem of the same name written in 1939 by Marks ' brother - in - law , Robert L. May . Since 1972 , the special has aired on CBS , with the network unveiling a high - definition , digitally remastered version of the program in 2005 . As with A Charlie Brown Christmas and How the Grinch Stole Christmas , Rudolph no longer airs just once annually , but several times during the Christmas and holiday season on CBS . Unlike other holiday specials that also air on several cable channels ( including Freeform ) , Rudolph only airs on CBS . It has been telecast every year since 1964 , making it the longest continuously running Christmas TV special in history . 2014 marked the 50th anniversary of the television special and a series of postage stamps featuring Rudolph was issued by the United States Postal Service on November 6 , 2014 . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot </Li> <Li> 2 Cast </Li> <Li> 3 Production <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Aftermath </Li> <Li> 3.2 Production credits </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Different versions <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Original 1964 NBC broadcast edit </Li> <Li> 4.2 1965 -- 1997 telecasts </Li> <Li> 4.3 1998 -- CBS telecasts </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Home media </Li> <Li> 6 Soundtrack </Li> <Li> 7 Merchandise </Li> <Li> 8 Reception </Li> <Li> 9 Sequels </Li> <Li> 10 In popular culture <Ul> <Li> 10.1 Films by Corky Quakenbush </Li> <Li> 10.2 Uses in advertising </Li> <Li> 10.3 Other References </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 11 Copyright issues </Li> <Li> 12 See also </Li> <Li> 13 References </Li> <Li> 14 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Plot ( edit ) </H2> <P> Sam the Snowman welcomes the viewers to Christmastown at the North Pole and introduces Santa and Mrs. Claus who live in a castle located north of the Christmas Tree Forest . Mrs. Claus fusses over Santa as she wants him to fatten up by Christmas Eve . Sam then recalls the year Christmas was almost cancelled due to a snowstorm and tells the story of how a very special reindeer saved the day . </P> <P> Donner , Santa 's lead reindeer , and his wife have given birth to their new baby fawn , Rudolph . Upon admiring him , they are surprised to see that Rudolph has been born with a glowing red nose . When Santa arrives , he warns Donner that Rudolph will not make the sleigh team because of his nose . Donner then decides to hide the nose by covering it with mud to allow Rudolph to fit in with all the other reindeer . </P> <P> Over Rudolph 's first year of life , Donner trains him in the basics of being a reindeer , including hiding from the Abominable Snow Monster of the North . Rudolph enters the reindeer games , competing against his fellow fawns . During flight practice , Rudolph meets a doe named Clarice who tells him he is cute , and kisses him , which causes an elated Rudolph to fly higher and faster than everyone else . However , while celebrating with the other bucks , Rudolph 's nose cover pops off , and the others react with fear , then scorn and finally rejection as Rudolph is kicked out of the Reindeer Games . Walking away , Rudolph walks with Clarice , who supports him , until her father firmly tells her to never have any more contacts with a red - nosed reindeer . Then , Rudolph meets up with Hermey , an elf who ran away from Santa 's workshop because he wanted to be a dentist instead of making toys , and they decide to run away together . The pair then meet a prospector named Yukon Cornelius , who has fruitlessly searched his whole life for silver and gold . After escaping the snow monster on an ice floe , the trio crash land on the Island of Misfit Toys where unloved or unwanted toys live with their ruler , a winged lion named King Moonracer . The king allows the group to stay one night on the island in exchange for returning to Christmastown to ask Santa to find homes for the unwanted toys . However , Rudolph leaves the island in the middle of the night on his own , fearing that his nose , which attracts the snow monster ? \nAnswer: ", "answer": "1964"}

It first aired Sunday , December 6 , 1964 , on the NBC television network in the United States , and was sponsored by General Electric under the umbrella title of The General Electric Fantasy Hour . The special was based on the Johnny Marks song `` Rudolph the Red - Nosed Reindeer '' which was itself based on the poem of the same name written in 1939 by Marks ' brother - in - law , Robert L. May . Since 1972 , the special has aired on CBS , with the network unveiling a high - definition , digitally remastered version of the program in 2005 .

L'Engle wrote repeatedly about the writing of the story and the long struggle to get it published . In A Circle of Quiet ( 1972 ) , she explains that the book was conceived `` during a time of transition . '' After years of living in rural Goshen , Connecticut , and running a general store , L'Engle's family , the Franklins , moved back to New York City , first taking a ten - week camping trip across the country and back again . L'Engle writes that `` we drove through a world of deserts and buttes and leafless mountains , wholly new and alien to me . And suddenly into my mind came the names , Mrs Whatsit . Mrs Who . Mrs Which . '' This was in the spring of 1959 . L'Engle was reading about quantum physics at the time , which also made its way into the story . When she completed the book in early 1960 , however , it was rejected by at least 26 publishers , because it was , in L'Engle's words , `` too different , '' and `` because it deals overtly with the problem of evil , and it was really difficult for children , and was it a children 's or an adults ' book , anyhow ? '' </P> <P> In `` A Special Message from Madeleine L'Engle '' on the Random House website , L'Engle explains another possible reason for the rejections : `` A Wrinkle in Time had a female protagonist in a science fiction book , '' which at the time was uncommon . After trying `` forty - odd '' publishers ( L'Engle later said `` twenty - six rejections '' ) , L'Engle's agent returned the manuscript to her .

{"context": "Answer the question based on the information provided in the document given below. The answer should be a number\n\nDocument:\nand adopted in 1782 . </P> <P> `` In God We Trust '' first appeared on the two - cent piece in 1864 and has appeared on paper currency since 1957 . A law passed in a Joint Resolution by the 84th Congress ( P.L. 84 - 140 ) and approved by President Dwight Eisenhower on July 30 , 1956 , declared `` In God We Trust '' must appear on American currency . This phrase was first used on paper money in 1957 , when it appeared on the one - dollar silver certificate . The first paper currency bearing the phrase entered circulation on October 1 , 1957 . The 84th Congress later passed legislation ( P.L. 84 - 851 ) , also signed by President Eisenhower on July 30 , 1956 , declaring the phrase to be the national motto . </P> <P> Some groups and people have expressed objections to its use , citing its religious reference that violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment . These groups believe the phrase should be removed from currency and public property . In lawsuits , this argument has so far not overcome the interpretational doctrine of accommodationism , which allows government to endorse religious establishments as long as they are all treated equally . According to a 2003 joint poll by USA Today , CNN , and Gallup , 90 % of Americans support the inscription `` In God We Trust '' on U.S. coins . </P> <P> In 2006 , `` In God We Trust '' was designated as the motto of the U.S. state of Florida . Its Spanish equivalent , En Dios Confiamos , is the motto of the Republic of Nicaragua . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Society and culture <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Religion </Li> <Li> 2.2 Pop culture </Li> <Li> 2.3 License plates </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Criticism </Li> <Li> 4 Gallery </Li> <Li> 5 See also </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> <Li> 7 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> Salmon P. Chase , Treasury Secretary , scribes `` In God is our Trust , '' scratches out `` is our '' and overwrites `` We '' to arrive at `` In God We Trust '' in a December 9 , 1863 , letter to James Pollock , Director of the Philadelphia Mint . `` IN GOD WE TRUST '' first appeared on the obverse side of the Two - cent piece in 1864 <P> In 1860 , the phrase was used in the Coat of arms of New Westminster , Canada . The phrase has been incorporated in many hymns and religio - patriotic songs . During the American Civil War , the 125th Pennsylvania Infantry for the Union Army assumed the motto `` In God we trust '' in early August 1862 . William W. Wallace , coiner , circa August 1862 , of the motto `` In God We Trust '' was Captain of Company C of the 125th Pennsylvania Infantry . </P> <P> The Reverend Mark R. Watkinson of ' Ridleyville ' , Pennsylvania , ( pastor of Prospect Hill Baptist Church in present - day Prospect Park , Pennsylvania ) in a letter dated November 13 , 1861 , petitioned the Treasury Department to add a statement recognizing `` Almighty God in some form on our coins '' in order to `` relieve us from the ignominy of heathenism '' . At least part of the motivation was to declare that God was on the Union side of the Civil War . Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase acted on this proposal and directed the then - Philadelphia Director of the Mint , James Pollock , to begin drawing up possible designs that would include the religious phrase . Chase chose his favorite designs and presented a proposal to Congress for the new designs in late 1863 . </P> <P> In December 1863 , Abraham Lincoln 's Secretary of the Treasury decided on a new motto , `` In God We Trust , '' to engrave on U.S. coins . Lincoln 's involvement in this decision is unclear . </P> <P> A version of the motto made an early appearance on obverse side of the twenty dollar interest bearing note issued in 1864 along with the motto `` God and our Right '' . </P> <P> As Chase was preparing his recommendation to Congress , it was found that the Act of Congress dated January 18 , 1837 prescribed the mottoes and devices that should be placed upon the coins of the United States . This meant that the mint could make no changes without the enactment of additional legislation by the Congress . Such legislation was introduced and passed as the Coinage Act of 1864 on April 22 , 1864 , allowing the Secretary of the Treasury to authorize the inclusion of the phrase on one - cent and two - cent coins . </P> <P> An Act of Congress passed on March 3 , 1865 , allowed the Mint Director , with the Secretary 's approval , to place the motto on all gold and silver coins that `` shall admit the inscription thereon '' . In 1873 , Congress passed the Coinage Act , granting that the Secretary of the Treasury `` may cause the motto IN GOD WE TRUST to be inscribed on such coins as shall admit of such motto '' . </P> <P> The similar phrase ' In God is our Trust ' appears in `` The Star - Spangled Banner '' , adopted as the national anthem of the United States in 1931 .

Wallace , coiner , circa August 1862 , of the motto `` In God We Trust '' was Captain of Company C of the 125th Pennsylvania Infantry . </P> <P> The Reverend Mark R. Watkinson of ' Ridleyville ' , Pennsylvania , ( pastor of Prospect Hill Baptist Church in present - day Prospect Park , Pennsylvania ) in a letter dated November 13 , 1861 , petitioned the Treasury Department to add a statement recognizing `` Almighty God in some form on our coins '' in order to `` relieve us from the ignominy of heathenism '' . At least part of the motivation was to declare that God was on the Union side of the Civil War . Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase acted on this proposal and directed the then - Philadelphia Director of the Mint , James Pollock , to begin drawing up possible designs that would include the religious phrase . Chase chose his favorite designs and presented a proposal to Congress for the new designs in late 1863 . </P> <P> In December 1863 , Abraham Lincoln 's Secretary of the Treasury decided on a new motto , `` In God We Trust , '' to engrave on U.S. coins . Lincoln 's involvement in this decision is unclear . </P> <P> A version of the motto made an early appearance on obverse side of the twenty dollar interest bearing note issued in 1864 along with the motto `` God and our Right '' . </P> <P> As Chase was preparing his recommendation to Congress , it was found that the Act of Congress dated January 18 , 1837 prescribed the mottoes and devices that should be placed upon the coins of the United States . This meant that the mint could make no changes without the enactment of additional legislation by the Congress . Such legislation was introduced and passed as the Coinage Act of 1864 on April 22 , 1864 , allowing the Secretary of the Treasury to authorize the inclusion of the phrase on one - cent and two - cent coins . </P> <P> An Act of Congress passed on March 3 , 1865 , allowed the Mint Director , with the Secretary 's approval , to place the motto on all gold and silver coins that `` shall admit the inscription thereon '' . In 1873 , Congress passed the Coinage Act , granting that the Secretary of the Treasury `` may cause the motto IN GOD WE TRUST to be inscribed on such coins as shall admit of such motto '' . </P> <P> The similar phrase ' In God is our Trust ' appears in `` The Star - Spangled Banner '' , adopted as the national anthem of the United States in 1931 . Written by Francis Scott Key during the War of 1812 , the fourth stanza includes the phrase , `` And this be our motto : ' In God is our Trust ' '' , which was adapted as the national motto . </P> <P> The use of `` In God We Trust '' has been interrupted . The motto disappeared from the five - cent coin in 1883 , and did not reappear until production of the Jefferson nickel began in 1938 . However , at least two other coins minted in every year in the interim still bore the motto , including the Morgan dollar and the Seated Liberty half dollar . The omission of the motto `` In God We Trust '' on the Indian Head eagle coin caused public outrage , and prompted Congress to pass a bill mandating its inclusion . Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber added the words and made minor modifications to the design . In 1908 , Congress made it mandatory that the phrase be printed on ? \nAnswer: ", "answer": "1864"}

{"context": "Answer the question based on the information provided in the document given below. The answer should be a number\n\nDocument:\nr Lane , to biographer William Anderson , the publisher had Wilder change her age in Prairie because it seemed unrealistic for a three - year - old to have memories so specific about her story of life in Kansas . To be consistent with her already established chronology , Wilder portrayed herself six to seven years old in Prairie and seven to nine years old in On the Banks of Plum Creek ( 1937 ) , the third volume of her fictionalized history , which takes place around 1874 . </P> <P> On the Banks of Plum Creek shows the family moving from Kansas to an area near Walnut Grove , Minnesota and settling in a dugout `` on the banks of Plum Creek '' . They really moved there from Wisconsin when Wilder was about seven years old , after briefly living with the family of Laura 's Uncle Peter Ingalls , first in their house in the Big Woods of Wisconsin and then on rented land near Lake City , Minnesota . In Walnut Grove Laura 's family first lived in a dugout on a preemption claim ; after wintering in the dugout they moved into a new house built on the same land . Two summers of ruined crops led the Ingalls to move to Iowa . On the way they stayed again with Laura 's Uncle Peter Ingalls , this time on his own farm near South Troy , Minnesota . Wilder 's younger and only brother , Charles Frederick Ingalls ( `` Freddie '' ) , was born there on November 1 , 1875 , and died nine months later on August 27 , 1876 . In Burr Oak , Iowa the Ingalls family helped run a hotel . Wilder 's youngest sibling , Grace , was born there on May 23 , 1877 . </P> <P> The family moved from Burr Oak back to Walnut Grove , where Wilder 's father served as the town butcher and justice of the peace . He accepted a railroad job in the spring of 1879 , which took him to eastern Dakota Territory , where they joined him that fall . Wilder did not write about 1876 -- 1877 , when they lived near Burr Oak , but skipped directly to Dakota Territory , portrayed in By the Shores of Silver Lake ( 1939 ) . Thus the fictional timeline caught up with her real life . </P> <H3> De Smet ( edit ) </H3> <P> Wilder 's father filed for a formal homestead over the winter of 1879 -- 1880 . De Smet , South Dakota became her parents ' and sister Mary Ingalls ' home for the remainder of their lives . After spending the mild winter of 1879 -- 1880 in the surveyor 's house , they watched the town of De Smet rise up from the prairie in 1880 . The following winter , 1880 -- 1881 , one of the most severe on record in the Dakotas , was later described by Wilder in her novel , The Long Winter ( 1940 ) . Once the family was settled in De Smet , Wilder attended school , worked several part - time jobs , and made friends . Among them was bachelor homesteader , Almanzo Wilder . This time in her life is documented in the books Little Town on the Prairie ( 1941 ) and These Happy Golden Years ( 1943 ) . </P> <H3> Young teacher ( edit ) </H3> <P> On December 10 , 1882 , two months before her 16th birthday , Wilder accepted her first teaching position . She taught three terms in one - room schools when she was not attending school in De Smet . ( In Little Town on the Prairie she receives her first teaching certificate on December 24 , 1882 , but that was an enhancement for dramatic effect. ) Her original `` Third Grade '' teaching certificate can be seen on page 25 of William Anderson 's book Laura 's Album ( 1998 ) . She later admitted she did not particularly enjoy teaching but felt the responsibility from a young age to help her family financially , and wage - earning opportunities for women were limited . Between 1883 and 1885 , she taught three terms of school , worked for the local dressmaker , and attended high school , although she did not graduate . </P> Laura and Almanzo Wilder , circa 1885 <P> Wilder 's teaching career and studies ended when she married Almanzo Wilder , whom she called `` Manly '' , on August 25 , 1885 . As he had a sister named Laura , his nickname for Wilder became `` Bess '' , from her middle name , Elizabeth . Wilder was 18 and he was 28 .

The answer should be a number\nQuestion: when did laura ingalls wilder move to missouri\n\nDocument:\nr Lane , to biographer William Anderson , the publisher had Wilder change her age in Prairie because it seemed unrealistic for a three - year - old to have memories so specific about her story of life in Kansas . To be consistent with her already established chronology , Wilder portrayed herself six to seven years old in Prairie and seven to nine years old in On the Banks of Plum Creek ( 1937 ) , the third volume of her fictionalized history , which takes place around 1874 . </P> <P> On the Banks of Plum Creek shows the family moving from Kansas to an area near Walnut Grove , Minnesota and settling in a dugout `` on the banks of Plum Creek '' . They really moved there from Wisconsin when Wilder was about seven years old , after briefly living with the family of Laura 's Uncle Peter Ingalls , first in their house in the Big Woods of Wisconsin and then on rented land near Lake City , Minnesota . In Walnut Grove Laura 's family first lived in a dugout on a preemption claim ; after wintering in the dugout they moved into a new house built on the same land . Two summers of ruined crops led the Ingalls to move to Iowa . On the way they stayed again with Laura 's Uncle Peter Ingalls , this time on his own farm near South Troy , Minnesota . Wilder 's younger and only brother , Charles Frederick Ingalls ( `` Freddie '' ) , was born there on November 1 , 1875 , and died nine months later on August 27 , 1876 . In Burr Oak , Iowa the Ingalls family helped run a hotel . Wilder 's youngest sibling , Grace , was born there on May 23 , 1877 . </P> <P> The family moved from Burr Oak back to Walnut Grove , where Wilder 's father served as the town butcher and justice of the peace . He accepted a railroad job in the spring of 1879 , which took him to eastern Dakota Territory , where they joined him that fall . Wilder did not write about 1876 -- 1877 , when they lived near Burr Oak , but skipped directly to Dakota Territory , portrayed in By the Shores of Silver Lake ( 1939 ) . Thus the fictional timeline caught up with her real life . </P> <H3> De Smet ( edit ) </H3> <P> Wilder 's father filed for a formal homestead over the winter of 1879 -- 1880 . De Smet , South Dakota became her parents ' and sister Mary Ingalls ' home for the remainder of their lives . After spending the mild winter of 1879 -- 1880 in the surveyor 's house , they watched the town of De Smet rise up from the prairie in 1880 . The following winter , 1880 -- 1881 , one of the most severe on record in the Dakotas , was later described by Wilder in her novel , The Long Winter ( 1940 ) . Once the family was settled in De Smet , Wilder attended school , worked several part - time jobs , and made friends . Among them was bachelor homesteader , Almanzo Wilder . This time in her life is documented in the books Little Town on the Prairie ( 1941 ) and These Happy Golden Years ( 1943 ) . </P> <H3> Young teacher ( edit ) </H3> <P> On December 10 , 1882 , two months before her 16th birthday , Wilder accepted her first teaching position . She taught three terms in one - room schools when she was not attending school in De Smet . ( In Little Town on the Prairie she receives her first teaching certificate on December 24 , 1882 , but that was an enhancement for dramatic effect. ) Her original `` Third Grade '' teaching certificate can be seen on page 25 of William Anderson 's book Laura 's Album ( 1998 ) . She later admitted she did not particularly enjoy teaching but felt the responsibility from a young age to help her family financially , and wage - earning opportunities for women were limited . Between 1883 and 1885 , she taught three terms of school , worked for the local dressmaker , and attended high school , although she did not graduate . </P> Laura and Almanzo Wilder , circa 1885 <P> Wilder 's teaching career and studies ended when she married Almanzo Wilder , whom she called `` Manly '' , on August 25 , 1885 . As he had a sister named Laura , his nickname for Wilder became `` Bess '' , from her middle name , Elizabeth . Wilder was 18 and he was 28 . He had achieved a degree of prosperity on his homestead claim , and their prospects seemed bright . She joined him in a new home , north of De Smet . </P> <H3> Children ( edit ) </H3> <P> On December 5 , 1886 , Wilder gave birth to her daughter Rose Wilder . In 1889 , Wilder gave birth to a son who died at 12 days of age before being named . He was buried at De Smet , Kingsbury County , in South Dakota .

Brooklyn Dodgers Team Photograph , 1913 <P> The Brooklyn Dodgers was an American Major League baseball team , active primarily in the National League from 1884 until 1957 , after which the club moved to Los Angeles , where it continues its history as the Los Angeles Dodgers . The team 's name derived from the reputed skill of Brooklyn residents at evading the city 's trolley streetcar network . The Dodgers played in two stadiums in South Brooklyn , each named Washington Park , and at Eastern Park in the neighborhood of Brownsville before moving to Ebbets Field in the neighborhood of Flatbush in 1913 . The team is noted for signing Jackie Robinson in 1947 as the first black player in the modern major leagues . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Early Brooklyn baseball <Ul> <Li> 1.1 The origin of the Dodgers </Li> <Li> 1.2 Nicknames </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Rivalry with the Giants <Ul> <Li> 2.1 `` Uncle Robbie '' and the `` Daffiness Boys '' </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Breaking the color barrier </Li> <Li> 4 `` Wait ' til next year !

Eight of 16 participants in the first convention were from Brooklyn , including the Atlantic , Eckford , and Excelsior clubs that combined to dominate play for most of the 1860s . Brooklyn helped make baseball commercial , as the locale of the first paid admission games , a series of three all star contests matching New York and Brooklyn in 1858 . Brooklyn also featured the first two enclosed baseball grounds , the Union Grounds and the Capitoline Grounds ; enclosed , dedicated ballparks accelerated the evolution from amateurism to professionalism . </P> <P> Despite the early success of Brooklyn clubs in the National Association of Base Ball Players , officially amateur until 1869 , they fielded weak teams in the succeeding National Association of Professional Base Ball Players , the first professional league formed in 1871 . The Excelsiors no longer challenged for the amateur championship after the Civil War and never entered the professional NA . The Eckfords and Atlantics declined to join until 1872 and thereby lost their best players ; the Eckfords survived only one season and the Atlantics four , with losing teams . </P> <P> The National League replaced the NA in 1876 and granted exclusive territories to its eight members , excluding the Atlantics in favor of the New York Mutuals who had shared home grounds with the Atlantics . When the Mutuals were expelled by the league , the Hartford Dark Blues club moved in , changed its name to The Brooklyn Hartfords and played its home games at Union Grounds in 1877 before disbanding . </P> <H3> The origin of the Dodgers ( edit ) </H3> <P> The team currently known as the Dodgers was formed as the Brooklyn Grays in 1883 by real estate magnate and baseball enthusiast Charles Byrne , who convinced his brother - in - law Joseph Doyle and casino operator Ferdinand Abell to start the team with him . Byrne arranged to build a grandstand on a lot bounded by Third Street , Fourth Avenue , Fifth Street , and Fifth Avenue , and named it Washington Park in honor of George Washington . The Grays played in the minor Inter-State Association of Professional Baseball Clubs that first season . Doyle became the first team manager , and they drew 6,431 fans to their first home game on May 12 , 1883 against the Trenton team . The Grays won the league title after the Camden Merritt club disbanded on July 20 and Brooklyn picked up some of its better players . The Grays were invited to join the American Association for the 1884 season . </P> <P> After winning the American Association league championship in 1889 , the Grays ( by then nicknamed the Bridegrooms ) moved to the National League and won the 1890 NL Championship , the only Major League team to win consecutive championships in both professional `` base ball '' leagues . They lost the 1889 World Series to the New York Giants and tied the 1890 World Series with the Louisville Colonels .

It is a common take - away food and an early example of culinary fusion . Fish and chips first appeared in the 1860s ; by 1910 there were more than 25,000 fish and chip shops across the UK , and by the 1930s there were over 35,000 . Fish and chips are now a staple takeaway meal in numerous countries , particularly in English - speaking commonwealth countries including Australia and New Zealand . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History <Ul> <Li> 1.1 United Kingdom </Li> <Li> 1.2 Fish & Chips Awards </Li> <Li> 1.3 Ireland </Li> <Li> 1.4 New Zealand </Li> <Li> 1.5 United States </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Composition <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Cooking </Li> <Li> 2.2 Thickness </Li> <Li> 2.3 Batter </Li> <Li> 2.4 Choice of fish </Li> <Li> 2.5 Accompaniments </Li> <Li> 2.6 Nutrition information </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Vendors </Li> <Li> 4 Cultural impact </Li> <Li> 5 Environment </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 Bibliography </Li> <Li> 9 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> Main article : English cuisine Fish and chips , served in a paper wrapper ( greaseproof paper inner and ordinary paper outer ) , as a `` takeaway '' <P> Fried fish as a culinary trend may have begun in Lancashire or it may have come from London 's Western Sephardic Jews . Originally , Western Sephardic Jews settling in England in the 17th century would have prepared fried fish in a manner similar to Pescado frito , which is coated in a flour . Battered fish is first coated in flour then dipped into a batter consisting of flour mixed with liquid , usually water but sometimes beer . Some newer modifications to the recipe may have cornflour added , and instead of beer sometimes soda water is added . In 1860 , the first fish and chip shop was opened in London by Joseph Malin who sold `` fish fried in the Jewish fashion '' . </P> <P> Fish and chips became a stock meal among the working classes in England as a consequence of the rapid development of trawl fishing in the North Sea , and the development of railways which connected the ports to major industrial cities during the second half of the 19th century , so that fresh fish could be rapidly transported to the heavily populated areas . </P> <P> Deep - fried chips ( slices or pieces of potato ) as a dish may have first appeared in England in about the same period : the Oxford English Dictionary notes as its earliest usage of `` chips '' in this sense the mention in Charles Dickens ' A Tale of Two Cities ( 1859 ) : `` Husky chips of potatoes , fried with some reluctant drops of oil '' . </P> <P> The modern fish - and - chip shop ( `` chippy '' or `` chipper '' in modern British slang ) originated in the United Kingdom , although outlets selling fried food occurred commonly throughout Europe . Early fish - and - chip shops had only very basic facilities . Usually these consisted principally of a large cauldron of cooking fat , heated by a coal fire . The fish - and - chip shop later evolved into a fairly standard format , with the food served , in paper wrappings , to queuing customers , over a counter in front of the fryers . By 1910 , there were more than 25,000 fish and chip shops across the country , and in the 1920s there were more than 35,000 shops .

During its recorded history , the area has also been known as Congo , Congo Free State , Belgian Congo , and Zaire . </P> <P> The Kingdom of Kongo existed from the 14th to the early 19th century .

Leopold was the sole shareholder and chairman . The state included the entire area of the present Democratic Republic of the Congo . Under Leopold II , the Congo Free State became one of the most infamous international scandals of the turn of the twentieth century . The report of the British Consul Roger Casement led to the arrest and punishment of white officials who had been responsible for cold - blooded killings during a rubber - collecting expedition in 1900 , including a Belgian national who caused the shooting of at least 122 Congolese natives . Estimates of the total death toll vary considerably . The first census was only done in 1924 , so it is even more difficult to quantify the population loss of the period . Roger Casement 's famous 1904 report estimated ten million people . According to Casement 's report , indiscriminate `` war '' , starvation , reduction of births and tropical diseases caused the country 's depopulation . European and U.S. press agencies exposed the conditions in the Congo Free State to the public in 1900 .

Kabila was assassinated by his bodyguard in 2001 , and his son , Joseph , succeeded him and was later elected president by the Congolese government in 2006 . Kabila quickly sought peace . Foreign soldiers remained in the Congo for a few years and a power - sharing government between Kabila and the opposition party was set up . Kabila later resumed complete control over the Congo and was re-elected in a disputed election in 2011 .

Subsequent legal actions by the city of Cleveland and Browns season ticket holders led the NFL to broker a compromise that saw the Browns history , records , and intellectual property remain in Cleveland . In return , Modell was permitted to move his football organization to Baltimore where he established the Baltimore Ravens . The Ravens are officially regarded by the NFL as an expansion team that began play in 1996 . The city of Cleveland agreed to demolish Cleveland Stadium and build a new stadium on the same site , and the NFL agreed to reactivate the Browns by the 1999 season through either an expansion draft or a relocated franchise . The Browns were officially reactivated in 1998 through the expansion process and resumed play in 1999 . </P> <P> The compromise between Cleveland , the NFL , and Modell was a first in North American professional sports . The compromise has been cited in franchise moves and agreements in other leagues , including those in Major League Baseball , Major League Soccer , the National Basketball Association , and the National Hockey League . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Dissatisfaction with Cleveland Stadium </Li> <Li> 2 Announcing the move </Li> <Li> 3 Initial reaction </Li> <Li> 4 Settlement </Li> <Li> 5 Aftermath and Legacy </Li> <Li> 6 Effect on teams in other sports leagues <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Major League Baseball </Li> <Li> 6.2 Major League Soccer </Li> <Li> 6.3 National Hockey League </Li> <Li> 6.4 National Basketball Association </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 Further reading </Li> <Li> 10 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Dissatisfaction with Cleveland Stadium ( edit ) </H2> Art Modell . <P> In 1975 , knowing that Municipal Stadium was costing the city over $300,000 annually to operate , then - Browns owner Art Modell signed a 25 - year lease whereby he agreed to incur these expenses in exchange for quasi ownership of the stadium . Under the terms of the lease he agreed to give back the City a portion of the profits he would realize each year , and also agreed to make capital improvements to the stadium at his expense . Modell 's newly formed company , Stadium Corporation , paid an annual rent of $150,000 for the first five years and $200,000 afterwards to the city . </P> <P> Modell had originally promised never to move the Browns . He had publicly criticized the Baltimore Colts ' move to Indianapolis , and had testified in favor of the NFL in court cases where the league unsuccessfully tried to stop Al Davis from moving the Oakland Raiders to Los Angeles . </P> <P> However , Modell refused to share the suite revenue with the Cleveland Indians , who also played at Cleveland Stadium , even though much of the revenues were generated during baseball games as well as football games . </P> <P> In 1990 , the Indians prevailed upon the local governments and voters and convinced them to build them their own facility where they controlled the suite revenue . Modell , mistakenly believing that his revenues were not endangered , agreed to participate in the Gateway Project that built Jacobs Field ( now Progressive Field ) for the Indians and Gund Arena ( now Quicken Loans Arena ) for the Cleveland Cavaliers . Modell 's assumptions proved incorrect , and Stadium Corp 's suite revenues declined sharply when the Indians moved from the stadium to Jacobs Field in 1994 . Soaring player salaries and deficits put additional financial pressure on the Browns ' owner . Modell claimed to have lost $21 million between 1993 and 1994 . </P> <H2> Announcing the move ( edit ) </H2> <P> After Modell realized how much revenue he lost from the Indians moving out of Cleveland Stadium , he requested an issue be placed on the ballot to provide $175 million in tax dollars to refurbish the outmoded and declining Cleveland Stadium . </P> <P> On the field , the Browns , coached by Bill Belichick , were coming off a playoff season in which the team finished 11 -- 5 and advanced to the second round of the playoffs entering the 1995 season .

Crockett went to Tod Gordon and asked him to hold a tournament for the NWA 's top prize , the NWA World Heavyweight Championship , in ECW 's home area of Philadelphia , Pennsylvania on August 27 , 1994 . NWA President Dennis Coralluzzo alleged that Crockett and Gordon were going to try to monopolize the title ( akin to Crockett 's actions in the 1980s ) and stated Crockett did not have the NWA board 's approval , which resulted in Coralluzzo personally overseeing the tournament . Gordon took offense at Coralluzzo for his power plays and began contemplating a plan to secede ECW from the NWA through a controversial and public manner that would attract attention to ECW and insult the NWA organization .

Coralluzzo believed that Douglas was a `` bad risk '' and had the tendency to no - show events . Douglas ultimately decided to go through with Gordon and Heyman 's plan , inspired by his father 's motto of `` doing right by the people that do right by you . '' After looking up and saying , `` This is it tonight , Dad , '' Douglas threw down the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt , stating that he did not want to be champion of a `` dead promotion '' that `` died seven years ago . '' He then raised the Eastern Championship Wrestling title belt and declared it to be a World Heavyweight Championship -- calling it the only real world title left in professional wrestling .

Gordon made the following announcement on the next edition of NWA - ECW programming : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> `` </Td> <Td> I listened with great interest as the representative of the NWA board of directors took it upon himself to inform you that they have the power to force NWA - Eastern Championship Wrestling not to recognize The Franchise , Shane Douglas , as a world heavyweight champion . Well , as of noon today , I have folded NWA - Eastern Championship Wrestling . In its place will be ECW - Extreme Championship Wrestling - and we recognize The Franchise , Shane Douglas , as our World Heavyweight Champion .

When recalling this event years later , Paul Heyman stated the following in a 1998 chat : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> `` </Td> <Td> The National Wrestling Alliance was old - school when old - school was n't hip anymore . We wanted to set our mark , we wanted to breakaway from the pack , we wanted to let the world know that we were n't just some independent promotion . </Td> <Td> '' </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Coralluzzo was interviewed after the event and declared that Douglas would be the world champion of the NWA `` whether he likes it or not '' , calling Douglas ' actions a `` disgrace '' and said he would move to have Douglas stripped of both the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and the Eastern Championship Wrestling Heavyweight Championship , calling him `` undeserving '' of both titles . Gordon made the following announcement on the next edition of NWA - ECW programming : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> `` </Td> <Td> I listened with great interest as the representative of the NWA board of directors took it upon himself to inform you that they have the power to force NWA - Eastern Championship Wrestling not to recognize The Franchise , Shane Douglas , as a world heavyweight champion . Well , as of noon today , I have folded NWA - Eastern Championship Wrestling . In its place will be ECW - Extreme Championship Wrestling - and we recognize The Franchise , Shane Douglas , as our World Heavyweight Champion . And we encourage any wrestler in the world today to come to the ECW to challenge for that belt . This is the ECW , Extreme Championship Wrestling , changing the face of professional wrestling . </Td> <Td> '' </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The promotion showcased many different styles of professional wrestling , including hardcore wrestling matches as well as lucha libre and Japanese wrestling styles . </P> <H3> ECW Arena and television syndication ( edit ) </H3> See also : ECW Hardcore TV <P> The bulk of ECW 's shows remained at the ECW Arena , a former warehouse secluded under a section of Interstate 95 . Seating comprised simple folding chairs and four sets of portable bleachers , and the whole sort of unconventional set up reflected the gritty style of the wrestling itself . Shows were actually broadcast on a Philadelphia local cable sports station ( SportsChannel America 's local affiliate , SportsChannel Philadelphia ) on Tuesday evenings . After Sports Channel Philadelphia went off the air in 1997 , the show moved to WPPX - TV 61 . It later moved to a former independent broadcast station ( WGTW 48 ) in Philadelphia on either Friday or Saturday night at 1 or 2 a.m. Shows were also aired on the MSG Network in NYC on Friday nights ( Early Saturday morning ) at 2 a.m. Due to the obscurity of the stations and ECW itself , as well as the lack of F? \nAnswer: ", "answer": "1992"}

Ultimately , after agreeing on some adjustments to the Draft Declaration , a vast majority of states recognized that these issues could be addressed by each country at the national level . </P> <P> The four states that voted against continued to express serious reservations about the final text of the Declaration as placed before the General Assembly . As mentioned above , all four opposing countries have since then changed their vote in favour of the Declaration . </P> Australia ( edit ) <P> Australia 's government opposed the Declaration in the General Assembly vote of 2007 , but has since endorsed the Declaration . Australia 's Mal Brough , Minister for Families , Community Services and Indigenous Affairs , referring to the provision regarding the upholding of indigenous peoples ' customary legal systems , said that `` There should only be one law for all Australians and we should not enshrine in law practices that are not acceptable in the modern world . '' </P> <P> Marise Payne , Liberal Party Senator for New South Wales , further elaborated on the Australian government 's objections to the Declaration in a speech to the Australian Senate : </P> <Ul> <Li> Concerns about references to self - determination and their potential to be misconstrued . </Li> <Li> Ignorance of contemporary realities concerning land and resources . `` They seem , to many readers , to require the recognition of Indigenous rights to lands which are now lawfully owned by other citizens , both Indigenous and non-Indigenous , and therefore to have some quite significant potential to impact on the rights of third parties . '' </Li> <Li> Concerns over the extension of Indigenous intellectual property rights under the declaration as unnecessary under current international and Australian law . </Li> <Li> The potential abuse of the right under the Declaration for indigenous peoples to unqualified consent on matters affecting them , `` which implies to some readers that they may then be able to exercise a right of veto over all matters of state , which would include national laws and other administrative measures . '' </Li> <Li> The exclusivity of indigenous rights over intellectual , real and cultural property , that `` does not acknowledge the rights of third parties -- in particular , their rights to access Indigenous land and heritage and cultural objects where appropriate under national law . '' Furthermore , that the Declaration `` fails to consider the different types of ownership and use that can be accorded to Indigenous people and the rights of third parties to property in that regard . '' </Li> <Li> Concerns that the Declaration places indigenous customary law in a superior position to national law , and that this may `` permit the exercise of practices which would not be acceptable across the board '' , such as customary corporal and capital punishments . </Li> </Ul> <P> In October 2007 former Australian Prime Minister John Howard pledged to hold a referendum on changing the constitution to recognise indigenous Australians if re-elected . He said that the distinctiveness of people 's identity and their rights to preserve their heritage should be acknowledged . </P> <P> On 3 April 2009 , the Rudd Government formally endorsed the Declaration . </P> Canada ( edit ) <P> The Canadian government said that while it supported the `` spirit '' of the declaration , it contained elements that were `` fundamentally incompatible with Canada 's constitutional framework '' , which includes both the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and Section 35 , which enshrines aboriginal and treaty rights . In particular , the Canadian government had problems with Article 19 ( which appears to require governments to secure the consent of indigenous peoples regarding matters of general public policy ) , and Articles 26 and 28 ( which could allow for the re-opening or repudiation of historically settled land claims ) . </P> <P> Former Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development Chuck Strahl described the document as `` unworkable in a Western democracy under a constitutional government . '' Strahl elaborated , saying `` In Canada , you are balancing individual rights vs. collective rights , and ( this ) document ... has none of that . By signing on , you default to this document by saying that the only rights in play here are the rights of the First Nations . And , of course , in Canada , that 's inconsistent with our constitution . '' He gave an example : `` In Canada ... you negotiate on this ... because ( native rights ) do n't trump all other rights in the country . You need also to consider the people who have sometimes also lived on those lands for two or three hundred years , and have hunted and fished alongside the First Nations . '' </P> <P> The Assembly of First Nations passed a resolution in December 2007 to invite Presidents Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Evo Morales to Canada to put pressure on the government to sign the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples , calling the two heads of state `` visionary leaders '' and demanding Canada resign its membership on the United Nations Human Rights Council . </P> <P> On 3 March 2010 , in the Speech From the Throne , the Governor General of Canada announced that the government was moving to endorse the declaration . `` We are a country with an Aboriginal heritage . A growing number of states have given qualified recognition to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples . Our Government will take steps to endorse this aspirational document in a manner fully consistent with Canada 's Constitution and laws .

It was often used to show objects moving as if by magic . The first instance of the stop motion technique can be credited to Albert E. Smith and J. Stuart Blackton for Vitagraph 's The Humpty Dumpty Circus ( 1897 ) , in which a toy circus of acrobats and animals comes to life . In 1902 , the film Fun in a Bakery Shop used the stop trick technique in the `` lightning sculpting '' sequence . French trick film maestro Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s used stop motion animation once to produce moving title - card letters in one of his short films , and a number of his special effects are based on stop motion photography . In 1907 , The Haunted Hotel is a new stop motion film by J. Stuart Blackton , and was a resounding success when released . Segundo de Chom\u00f3n ( 1871 -- 1929 ) , from Spain , released El Hotel El\u00e9ctrico later that same year , and used similar techniques as the Blackton film . In 1908 , A Sculptor 's Welsh Rarebit Nightmare was released , as was The Sculptor 's Nightmare , a film by Billy Bitzer . Italian animator Rom\u00e9o Bossetti impressed audiences with his object animation tour - de-force , The Automatic Moving Company in 1912 . The great European stop motion pioneer was Wladyslaw Starewicz ( 1892 -- 1965 ) , who animated The Beautiful Lukanida ( 1910 ) , The Battle of the Stag Beetles ( 1910 ) , The Ant and the Grasshopper ( 1911 ) . </P> <P> One of the earliest clay animation films was Modelling Extraordinary , which impressed audiences in 1912 .

After learning under O'Brien on the film Mighty Joe Young ( 1949 ) , Harryhausen would go on to create the effects for a string of successful and memorable films over the next three decades .

Under the name of `` Animagic '' , the stop motion works of Rankin / Bass were supervised by Tadahito Mochinaga at his MOM Production in Tokyo , Japan . </P> <P> In 1975 , filmmaker and clay animation experimenter Will Vinton joined with sculptor Bob Gardiner to create an experimental film called Closed Mondays which became the world 's first stop motion film to win an Oscar . Will Vinton followed with several other successful short film experiments including The Great Cognito , Creation , and Rip Van Winkle which were each nominated for Academy Awards . In 1977 , Vinton made a documentary about this process and his style of animation which he dubbed `` claymation '' ; he titled the documentary Claymation . Soon after this documentary , the term was trademarked by Vinton to differentiate his team 's work from others who had been , or were beginning to do , `` clay animation '' . While the word has stuck and is often used to describe clay animation and stop motion , it remains a trademark owned currently by Laika Entertainment , Inc . Twenty clay - animation episodes featuring the clown Mr. Bill were a feature of Saturday Night Live , starting from a first appearance in February 1976 . </P> <P> At very much the same time in the UK , Peter Lord and David Sproxton formed Aardman Animations . In 1976 they created the character Morph who appeared as an animated side - kick to the TV presenter Tony Hart on his BBC TV programme Take Hart . The five - inch - high presenter was made from a traditional British modelling clay called Plasticine . In 1977 they started on a series of animated films , again using modelling clay , but this time made for a more adult audience . The soundtrack for Down and Out was recorded in a Salvation Army Hostel and Plasticine puppets were animated to dramatise the dialogue . A second film , also for the BBC followed in 1978 . A TV series The Amazing Adventures of Morph was aired in 1980 . </P> <P> Sand - coated puppet animation was used in the O? \nAnswer: ", "answer": "1897"}

The answer should be a number\n\nDocument:\nCH is dysgenesis of the thyroid gland After many years of newborn screening , the incidence of CH worldwide had been estimated at 1 : 3600 births , with no obvious increases in specific ethnic groups . Recent data from certain regions have showed an increase , with New York reporting an incidence of 1 : 1700 . Reasons for the apparent increase in incidence have been studied , but no explanation has been found . </P> <P> Classic CAH , the disorder targeted by newborn screening programs , is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme steroid 21 - hydroxylase , and comes in two forms - simple virilizing and a salt - wasting form . Incidence of CAH can vary greatly between populations . The highest reported incidence rates are among the Yupic Eskimos of Alaska ( 1 : 280 ) and on the French island of R\u00e9union ( 1 : 2100 ) . </P> <H3> Hemoglobinopathies ( edit ) </H3> Sickle cells in human blood : both normal red blood cells and sickle - shaped cells are present <P> Any condition that results in the production of abnormal hemoglobin is included under the broad category of hemoglobinopathies . Worldwide , it is estimated that 7 % of the population may carry a hemoglobinopathy with clinical significance . The most well known condition in this group is sickle cell disease . Newborn screening for a large number of hemoglobinopathies is done by detecting abnormal patterns using isoelectric focusing , which can detect many different types of abnormal hemoglobins . In the United States , newborn screening for sickle cell disease was recommended for all infants in 1987 , however it was not implemented in all 50 states until 2006 . </P> <P> Early identification of individuals with sickle cell disease and other hemoglobinopathies allows treatment to be initiated in a timely fashion . Penicillin has been used in children with sickle cell disease , and blood transfusions are used for patients identified with severe thalassemia . </P> <H3> Organic acidemias ( edit ) </H3> <P> Most jurisdictions did not start screening for any of the organic acidemias before tandem mass spectrometry significantly expanded the list of disorders detectable by newborn screening . Quebec has run a voluntary second - tier screening program since 1971 using urine samples collected at three weeks of age to screen for an expanded list of organic acidemias using a thin layer chromatography method . Newborn screening using tandem mass spectrometry can detect several organic acidemias , including propionic acidemia , methylmalonic acidemia and isovaleric acidemia . </P> <H3> Cystic fibrosis ( edit ) </H3> <P> Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) was first added to newborn screening programs in New Zealand and regions of Australia in 1981 , by measuring immunoreactive trypsinogen ( IRT ) in dried blood spots .

After the CFTR gene was identified , Australia introduced a two tier testing program to reduce the number of false positives . Samples with an elevated IRT value were then analyzed with molecular methods to identify the presence of disease causing mutations before being reported back to parents and health care providers . CF is included in the core panel of conditions recommended for inclusion in all 50 states , Texas was the last state to implement their screening program for CF in 2010 . Alberta was the first Canadian province to implement CF screening in 2007 . Quebec , New Brunswick , Nova Scotia , Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island do not include CF in their screening programs .

MCADD was the first condition added when the United Kingdom expanded their screening program from PKU only . Population based studies in Germany , the United States and Australia put the combined incidence of fatty acid oxidation disorders at 1 : 9300 among Caucasians .

The Arena Football League included three teams in Las Vegas over the course of its history : the Las Vegas Sting ( 1994 and 1995 ) , Las Vegas Gladiators ( 2003 to 2007 , now the Cleveland Gladiators ) , and another Las Vegas Outlaws ( 2015 ) .

The answer should be a number\n\nDocument:\nmary means of relief for people not able to support themselves . The 1890s economic depression and the rise of the trade unions and the Labor parties during this period led to a movement for welfare reform . </P> <P> In 1900 , the states of New South Wales and Victoria enacted legislation introducing non-contributory pensions for those aged 65 and over . Queensland legislated a similar system in 1907 before the Australian labor Commonwealth government led by Andrew Fisher introduced a national aged pension under the Invalid and Old - Aged Pensions Act 1908 . A national invalid diasbility pension was started in 1910 , and a national maternity allowance was introduced in 1912 . </P> <P> During the Second World War , Australia under a labor government created a welfare state by enacting national schemes for : child endowment in 1941 ( superseding the 1927 New South Wales scheme ) ; a widows ' pension in 1942 ( superseding the New South Wales 1926 scheme ) ; a wife 's allowance in 1943 ; additional allowances for the children of pensioners in 1943 ; and unemployment , sickness , and special benefits in 1945 ( superseding the Queensland 1923 scheme ) . </P> <P> The Social Services Legislation Amendment ( Welfare Reform ) Bill 2017 has changed several aspects of social security in Australia , and has been given assent to as of 11 April 2018 . It includes a demerit - point system for not meeting welfare obligations . </P> <H2> Contemporary welfare attitudes ( edit ) </H2> <P> Current attitudes toward welfare in Australia can be separated into support for the welfare system and support for welfare recipients . A multivariate analysis using canonical correlation analysis identified five distinct profiles of welfare attitudes and socio - demographic characteristics . The main attitude cluster was one toward support for the welfare system and welfare recipients . Having receiving government welfare in the past strongly predicted a person supporting the welfare system and its beneficiaries . The next most prominent attitude profile was summarized as ' the welfare system is good but the people on it are lazy and dependent ' .

The 1890s economic depression and the rise of the trade unions and the Labor parties during this period led to a movement for welfare reform . </P> <P> In 1900 , the states of New South Wales and Victoria enacted legislation introducing non-contributory pensions for those aged 65 and over . Queensland legislated a similar system in 1907 before the Australian labor Commonwealth government led by Andrew Fisher introduced a national aged pension under the Invalid and Old - Aged Pensions Act 1908 . A national invalid diasbility pension was started in 1910 , and a national maternity allowance was introduced in 1912 . </P> <P> During the Second World War , Australia under a labor government created a welfare state by enacting national schemes for : child endowment in 1941 ( superseding the 1927 New South Wales scheme ) ; a widows ' pension in 1942 ( superseding the New South Wales 1926 scheme ) ; a wife 's allowance in 1943 ; additional allowances for the children of pensioners in 1943 ; and unemployment , sickness , and special benefits in 1945 ( superseding the Queensland 1923 scheme ) . </P> <P> The Social Services Legislation Amendment ( Welfare Reform ) Bill 2017 has changed several aspects of social security in Australia , and has been given assent to as of 11 April 2018 . It includes a demerit - point system for not meeting welfare obligations . </P> <H2> Contemporary welfare attitudes ( edit ) </H2> <P> Current attitudes toward welfare in Australia can be separated into support for the welfare system and support for welfare recipients . A multivariate analysis using canonical correlation analysis identified five distinct profiles of welfare attitudes and socio - demographic characteristics . The main attitude cluster was one toward support for the welfare system and welfare recipients . Having receiving government welfare in the past strongly predicted a person supporting the welfare system and its beneficiaries . The next most prominent attitude profile was summarized as ' the welfare system is good but the people on it are lazy and dependent ' . This attitude profile was found among people receiving welfare payments that were either normative ( e.g. the age pension ) or where there is little expectation that a person will return to work ( e.g. disability support pension ) . Overall , Australian 's hold more negative attitudes toward welfare recipients than they do the welfare system . People with a history of receiving unemployment benefits tend to have more negative welfare attitudes if they live in areas where other community members have more negative attitudes . </P> <H2> Legal framework ( edit ) </H2> <P> Social security payments and other benefits are currently made available under the following acts of parliament : </P> <Ul> <Li> Social Security Act 1991 </Li> <Li> A New Tax System ( Family Assistance ) Act 1999 </Li> <Li> Student Assistance Act 1973 </Li> <Li> Paid Parental Leave Act 2010 </Li> </Ul> <H2> Payments under the Social Security Act and the student Assistance Act ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> ABSTUDY -- offers a range of allowances to assist Indigenous students and New Apprentices . </Li> <Li> Age Pension -- for people planning for retirement or who are already retired aged 65 years and over . </Li> <Li> Assistance for Isolated Children -- for families with a child who can not attend school locally because of distance or special needs . </Li> <Li> Austudy Payment -- for full - time students and New Apprentices aged 25 years or over . </Li> <Li> Carer Allowance -- for people who care for minors 16 -- 17 and adults over 18 years with a disability . </Li> <Li> Carer Allowance ( Child ) -- for people who care for a child under 16 years with a disability . </Li> <Li> Carer Payment -- for people who provide full - time care for someone with a disability </Li> <Li> Disability Support Pension -- for people unable to work for 2 years due to illness , injury or disability . </Li> <Li> Double Orphan Pension -- for people who are raising children who have lost both parents . </Li> <Li> Maternity Payment -- for help with tho? \nAnswer: ", "answer": "1908"}

{"context": "Answer the question based on the information provided in the document given below. The answer should be a number\n\nDocument:\nhigh school and college football games . Since high school and college teams typically play games on Friday and Saturday , respectively , the NFL can not hold games on those days until those seasons generally end in mid-December . </P> <P> From 1961 through 1977 , the NFL schedule consisted of fourteen regular season games played over fourteen weeks , except in 1966 . Opening weekend typically was the weekend after Labor Day , or rarely two weekends after Labor Day . Teams played six or seven exhibition games . In 1966 ( and 1960 ) , the NFL had an odd number of franchises , so one team was idle each week . In 1978 , the league changed the schedule to include sixteen regular season games and four exhibition games . From 1978 through 1989 , the sixteen games were played over sixteen weeks . </P> <P> In 1990 , the NFL re-introduced a bye week to the schedule , which it had not had since 1966 . Each team played sixteen regular season games over seventeen weeks . During the season , on a rotating basis , each team would have the weekend off . As a result , opening weekend was moved up to Labor Day weekend . The league had an odd number of teams ( 31 ) from 1999 to 2001 . During that period , at least one team had to be given a bye on any given week . For the 1993 season , the league experimented with the schedule by adding a second bye week for each team , resulting in an 18 - week regular season . In 2001 , the September 11th attacks resulted in the league postponing its week 2 games , leading to another 18 - week season . </P> <P> Since the 2002 season , the league has scheduled a nationally televised regular season kickoff game on the Thursday night after Labor Day , prior to the first Sunday of NFL games to kick off the season . The first one , featuring the San Francisco 49ers and the New York Giants , was held on September 5 , 2002 largely to celebrate New York City 's resilience in the wake of the September 11 , 2001 attacks . Since 2004 , the NFL has indicated that the opening game will normally be hosted by the defending Super Bowl champions as the official start of their title defense . Under this scheduling system , the earliest the regular season could begin is September 4 , as it was in the 2008 and 2014 seasons , due to September 1 falling on a Monday , while the latest possible is September 10 , as it was in the 2009 and 2015 seasons , due to September 1 falling on a Tuesday . </P> <H2> Scheduling formula ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Current formula ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> POS </Th> <Th> NFC East </Th> <Th> NFC North </Th> <Th> NFC South </Th> <Th> NFC West </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1st </Td> <Td> Eagles </Td> <Td> Vikings </Td> <Td> Saints </Td> <Td> Seahawks </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2nd </Td> <Td> Cowboys </Td> <Td> Lions </Td> <Td> Panthers </Td> <Td> Rams </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 3rd </Td> <Td> Redskins </Td> <Td> Packers </Td> <Td> Falcons </Td> <Td> Cardinals </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 4th </Td> <Td> Giants </Td> <Td> Bears </Td> <Td> Buccaneers </Td> <Td> 49ers </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"5\"> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> POS </Th> <Th> AFC East </Th> <Th> AFC North </Th> <Th> AFC South </Th> <Th> AFC West </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1st </Td> <Td> Patriots </Td> <Td> Steelers </Td> <Td> Jaguars </Td> <Td> Chiefs </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2nd </Td> <Td> Bills </Td> <Td> Ravens </Td> <Td> Titans </Td> <Td> Chargers </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 3rd </Td> <Td> Dolphins </Td> <Td> Bengals </Td> <Td> Colts </Td> <Td> Raiders </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 4th </Td> <Td> Jets </Td> <Td> Browns </Td> <Td> Texans </Td> <Td> Broncos </Td> </Tr> </Table> This chart of the 2017 season standings displays an application of the NFL scheduling formula . The Philadelphia Eagles in 2017 ( highlighted in green ) finished in first place in the NFC East . Thus , in 2018 , the Eagles will play two games against each of its division rivals ( highlighted in light blue ) , one game against each team in the NFC South and AFC South ( highlighted in yellow ) , and one game each against the first - place finishers in the NFC North and NFC West ( highlighted in orange ) . <P> Currently , the thirteen different opponents each team faces over the 16 - game regular season schedule are set using a pre-determined formula : </P> <Ul> <Li> Each team plays twice against each of the other three teams in its division : once at home , and once on the road ( six games ) . </Li> <Li> Each team plays once against each of the four teams from another division within its own conference , with the assigned division based on a three - year rotation : two at home , and two on the road ( four games ) . </Li> <Li> Each team plays once against one team from each of the remaining two divisions within its conference , based on the final division standings from the prior season : one at home , one on the road ( two games ) . </Li> <Li> Each team plays once against each of the four teams from a division in the other conference , with the assigned division based on a four - year rotation : two at home , and two on the road ( four games ) . </Li> </Ul> <P> Under this formula , all teams are guaranteed to play every other team in their own conference at least once every three years , and to play every team in the other conference exactly once every four years .

The current NFL television contract awards the American broadcast of these games to Fox or CBS , with Fox showing games where the visiting team is from the NFC and CBS showing games where the visiting team is from the AFC . Each of these Sunday afternoon games is televised on a regional basis to a few or several areas around the country . </P> <P> On each Sunday of the regular season , either CBS or Fox air two games in a doubleheader package , while the other network may show only one game . Late games scheduled to air on the network showing only one game are scheduled to start at 4 : 00pm EST , while the second game of a doubleheader will kick off later at 4 : 25pm ; this is to avoid conflicts with 1 : 00pm games that have run late . </P> <P> The schedule allows for 4 other regular time slots , in which these games are broadcast nationally across the country : </P> <Ol> <Li> One Sunday night game , which has been regularly scheduled since 1987 , and has aired on NBC since 2006 . </Li> <Li> One Monday Night Football game , which has been regularly scheduled since 1970 , and has been appearing on ESPN since 2006 . Also since 2006 , two games have been on the first Monday of the season . The practice of holding a Monday night game during the last week of the season ended after the 2002 season due to , among other reasons , low ratings , and a competitive imbalance involved for potential playoff teams who would have one less day of rest before the postseason . </Li> <Li> On Thursday nights since 2006 , one game has been played and aired on the NFL Network on the weeks including and after Thanksgiving Day . In addition , during the day on Thanksgiving , the NFL has played Thanksgiving Day games since 1920 ; by tradition the Dallas Cowboys and the Detroit Lions always host these afternoon games , and in recent years there has been a night game as well on Thanksgiving . Beginning with the 2012 season , the NFL has played games on Thursday nights for the whole season . </Li> <Li> Should there be a need for it , an occasional Saturday afternoon or night game , only in mid to late December , due to the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961 . December Saturday games have been a part of the schedule every season since 1970 , except for 2013 . </Li> </Ol> <P> Since the 2006 season , the NFL has used a `` flexible scheduling '' system for the last seven weeks of the regular season when there is a Sunday night game . In 2014 , that was expanded to include weeks 5 -- 17 .

{"context": "Answer the question based on the information provided in the document given below. The answer should be a number\nQuestion: when did the nfl change to a 16 game schedule\n\nDocument:\nLi> <Li> 5 Regular season games played outside the U.S. </Li> <Li> 6 Disruptions of the schedule <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Conflicts with other sports leagues and organizations </Li> <Li> 6.2 Labor disputes </Li> <Li> 6.3 Natural disasters </Li> <Li> 6.4 Other major news events </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Game times ( edit ) </H2> Main article : NFL on television <P> Since 1990 , the majority of NFL regular - season games are played on Sundays at 1 pm , or around 4 : 00 to 4 : 25pm ET ( see below ) , with the late afternoon ( ET ) games usually reserved either for matches hosted in the Pacific Time Zone or Mountain Time Zone , or for one or more marquee contests . The current NFL television contract awards the American broadcast of these games to Fox or CBS , with Fox showing games where the visiting team is from the NFC and CBS showing games where the visiting team is from the AFC . Each of these Sunday afternoon games is televised on a regional basis to a few or several areas around the country . </P> <P> On each Sunday of the regular season , either CBS or Fox air two games in a doubleheader package , while the other network may show only one game . Late games scheduled to air on the network showing only one game are scheduled to start at 4 : 00pm EST , while the second game of a doubleheader will kick off later at 4 : 25pm ; this is to avoid conflicts with 1 : 00pm games that have run late . </P> <P> The schedule allows for 4 other regular time slots , in which these games are broadcast nationally across the country : </P> <Ol> <Li> One Sunday night game , which has been regularly scheduled since 1987 , and has aired on NBC since 2006 . </Li> <Li> One Monday Night Football game , which has been regularly scheduled since 1970 , and has been appearing on ESPN since 2006 . Also since 2006 , two games have been on the first Monday of the season . The practice of holding a Monday night game during the last week of the season ended after the 2002 season due to , among other reasons , low ratings , and a competitive imbalance involved for potential playoff teams who would have one less day of rest before the postseason . </Li> <Li> On Thursday nights since 2006 , one game has been played and aired on the NFL Network on the weeks including and after Thanksgiving Day . In addition , during the day on Thanksgiving , the NFL has played Thanksgiving Day games since 1920 ; by tradition the Dallas Cowboys and the Detroit Lions always host these afternoon games , and in recent years there has been a night game as well on Thanksgiving . Beginning with the 2012 season , the NFL has played games on Thursday nights for the whole season . </Li> <Li> Should there be a need for it , an occasional Saturday afternoon or night game , only in mid to late December , due to the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961 . December Saturday games have been a part of the schedule every season since 1970 , except for 2013 . </Li> </Ol> <P> Since the 2006 season , the NFL has used a `` flexible scheduling '' system for the last seven weeks of the regular season when there is a Sunday night game . In 2014 , that was expanded to include weeks 5 -- 17 . Flex scheduling ensures quality matchups on Sunday nights and it allows for surprise teams to play in primetime . </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> Number of regular season games per team </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1935 -- 1936 </Td> <Td> 12 games </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1937 -- 1942 , 1946 </Td> <Td> 11 games ( 12 weeks ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1943 -- 1945 </Td> <Td> 10 games ( 12 weeks ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1947 -- 1960 </Td> <Td> 12 games ( variable weeks ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1961 -- 1965 , 1967 - 1977 </Td> <Td> 14 games ( 14 weeks ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1966 </Td> <Td> 14 games ( 15 weeks , odd number of teams ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1978 -- 1981 , 1983 -- 1986 , 1988 -- 1989 </Td> <Td> 16 games ( 16 weeks ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1982 </Td> <Td> 9 games ( 17 weeks , strike ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> 15 games ( 16 weeks , strike ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1990 -- 1992 , 1994 -- 2000 , 2002 -- present </Td> <Td> 16 games ( 17 weeks ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1993 </Td> <Td> 16 games ( 18 weeks , additional bye week ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2001 </Td> <Td> 16 games ( 18 weeks , September 11 attacks ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> In its early years after 1920 , the NFL did not have a set schedule , and teams played as few as eight and as many as sixteen games , many against independent professional , college , or amateur teams . From 1926 through 1946 , they played from eleven to fourteen games per season , depending on the number of teams in the league . From 1947 through 1960 , each NFL team played 12 games per season . The American Football League began play in 1960 and introduced a balanced schedule of 14 games per team over a fifteen - week season , in which each of the eight teams played each of the other teams twice , with one bye week . Competition from the new league caused the NFL to expand and follow suit with a fourteen - game schedule in 1961 . </P> <P> Also in 1961 , the U.S. Congress passed the Sports Broadcasting Act in response to a court decision which ruled that the NFL 's method of negotiating television broadcasting rights violated antitrust laws . The law allows the league to sell the rights to all regular season and postseason games to the networks , but prohibits the league from directly competing with high school and college football games . Since high school and college teams typically play games on Friday and Saturday , respectively , the NFL can not hold games on those days until those seasons generally end in mid-December . </P> <P> From 1961 through 1977 , the NFL schedule consisted of fourteen regular season games played over fourteen weeks , except in 1966 . Opening weekend typically was the weekend after Labor Day , or rarely two weekends after Labor Day . Teams played six or seven exhibition games . In 1966 ( and 1960 ) , the NFL had an odd number of franchises , so one team was idle each week . In 1978 , the league changed the schedule to include sixteen regular season games and four exhibition games . From 1978 through 1989 , the sixteen games were played over sixteen weeks . </P> <P> In ? \nAnswer: ", "answer": "1978"}

It was the most successful Bond theme to that point , charting at No. 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and No. 9 on the UK Singles Chart . </P> <P> Commissioned specifically for the movie , it reunited the former Beatle with the band 's producer , George Martin , who produced the song and arranged the orchestra . It has been covered by several bands , with the Guns N ' Roses version being the most popular cover . Both the McCartney and the Guns N ' Roses versions were nominated for Grammy Awards . In 2012 , McCartney was awarded the Million - Air Award from Broadcast Music , Inc .

Broccoli invited Paul McCartney to write the theme song . McCartney asked to be sent a copy of Ian Fleming 's novel . `` I read it and thought it was pretty good . That afternoon I wrote the song and went in the next week and did it ... It was a job of work for me in a way because writing a song around a title like that 's not the easiest thing going . '' </P> <P> Originally , producer Harry Saltzman was interested in having Shirley Bassey or Thelma Houston perform it instead of Wings . Martin said McCartney would allow the song to be used in the movie only if Wings was able to perform the song in the opening credits . Saltzman , who had previously rejected the chance to produce A Hard Day 's Night , decided not to make the same mistake twice and agreed . A second version of the song , performed by B.J. Arnau , also appears in the film . Arnau 's performance originally was meant for the group Fifth Dimension . The Arnau version of the song appears on the soundtrack album as a component in a medley that also contains two George Martin - composed instrumental pieces , `` Fillet of Soul -- New Orleans '' and `` Fillet of Soul -- Harlem '' .

It was the most successful Bond theme to that point , charting at No. 2 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and No. 9 on the UK Singles Chart . </P> <P> Commissioned specifically for the movie , it reunited the former Beatle with the band 's producer , George Martin , who produced the song and arranged the orchestra . It has been covered by several bands , with the Guns N ' Roses version being the most popular cover . Both the McCartney and the Guns N ' Roses versions were nominated for Grammy Awards . In 2012 , McCartney was awarded the Million - Air Award from Broadcast Music , Inc .

Broccoli invited Paul McCartney to write the theme song . McCartney asked to be sent a copy of Ian Fleming 's novel . `` I read it and thought it was pretty good . That afternoon I wrote the song and went in the next week and did it ... It was a job of work for me in a way because writing a song around a title like that 's not the easiest thing going . '' </P> <P> Originally , producer Harry Saltzman was interested in having Shirley Bassey or Thelma Houston perform it instead of Wings . Martin said McCartney would allow the song to be used in the movie only if Wings was able to perform the song in the opening credits . Saltzman , who had previously rejected the chance to produce A Hard Day 's Night , decided not to make the same mistake twice and agreed . A second version of the song , performed by B.J. Arnau , also appears in the film . Arnau 's performance originally was meant for the group Fifth Dimension . The Arnau version of the song appears on the soundtrack album as a component in a medley that also contains two George Martin - composed instrumental pieces , `` Fillet of Soul -- New Orleans '' and `` Fillet of Soul -- Harlem '' .
